<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
<P>
Many people talk about phased or incremental integration,
or top-down vs bottom-up, as if it were a matter of taste
(like which shirt to wear), or perhaps an article of conviction
(like which end of a soft-boiled egg you should crack). 
Nothing could be further from the truth:
<P>
<UL>
   <LI> integration strategy is the order and manner in
	which independent pieces of a system are combined.
   <LI> integration order needs to parallel the order
        in which components are built.
   <LI> the order in which components are built responds
	to the integration strategy, but is also driven
	by risk and resource issues.
   <LI> the testing strategy is driven by the order and
	context in which components can be tested, which
	is determined by the integration strategy.
   <LI> the manner and order in which components can be
	incrementally assembled is largely dictated 
	by the system architecture.
</UL>
<P>
Integration strategy is also often discussed as if we had 
a bunch of complete components, and were just trying to
figure out the order in which we should add them to the
system.  In new products, components usually continue
to evolve after their initial integration.  The integration
strategy must order, not only the components, but the
implementation of features and functions within each 
component.
<P>
Integration strategy is a crucial and inseparable element
of the product architecture and project development plans.
A good integration strategy is one that, in combination with
the architecture:
<UL>
   <LI> makes it possible to build and test a relatively complete 
	(tho perhaps initially boring) product from day one.
   <LI> allows components to be constructed independently,
	and in a natural order (as dictated by risk, resources,
	and other external drivers).
   <LI> allows components to be integrated in an incremental
  	fashion to ease testing and debugging.
   <LI> provides a meaningful framework for each new component
	to integrate into.
   <LI> makes it possible to integrate and exercise earlier
     	components without having to wait for later components.
   <LI> delivers incrementally usable and testable functionality
	with successive integrations.
   <LI> reduces the impact that delays or difficulties in
	the construction of one component can have on others.
</UL>
<P>
Many discussions of integration strategy are predicated on the
assumption that we are combining multiple components that have
never seen one-another before.  This is probably the worst-case
scenario, and the one that demands the most thorough analysis.
It is not, however, a common situation.  More common are
situations where there is an existing system, into which a few
new components and functions are to be introduced.  In such
cases, the integration will be incremental, and the starting
point is a given ... but careful consideration may still be 
required in the introduction of new functionality.
<P>
<H2>2. Integration and Testing</H2>
<P>
There are three principles of testing that bear on 
integration strategy:
<OL type=1>
   <LI>	Test new code as soon and thoroughly as possible.
   <LI> Test component interfaces as soon and thoroughly as possible.
   <LI> Add new functionality and then test it in small, progressive increments.
</OL>
<P>
All three of these principles follow from the simple realizations 
that it is easier to test a small amount of code than a large amount 
of code, and it is easier to test a change, when the pre-existing
code was known to be working.
<P>
We can always build a special test harness to exercise new code,
but it is often preferable to exercise the new code in a complete
system:
<UL>
   <LI> The complete system often has external interfaces (e.g. driving
	GUIs, command line arguments, or input files) that can be used
	to drive scenarios.
   <LI> Exercising a component in a complete system tests it in a more
	realistic environment.
   <LI> Custom exercise harnesses are always extra work, and usually
        thrown away as soon as the component can be integrated into
	a more complete system.
</UL>
<P>
Thus, for each component, we must ask ourselves how we will exercise it
in its early stages of development.  An integration strategy that provides
an exercise frameworks for new components as they are added is a good one.
Note, however, that custom exercise harnesses are not always a bad idea.
Some components have such rich and complex interactions with other 
components, that unit testing can be performed much more efficiently
and effectively with a custom exercise harness.  In these cases, the
component should be designed with the exerciser in mind, and the 
exerciser should be built to last ... because it may continue to be
the preferred means of unit testing changes to the component, 
even after integration has completed.
<P>
It is often desirable to verify that a component correctly implements
the specified interfaces with unit test cases (whether applied to
the component in-vacuuo or in-situ).  Many problems, however, result
from misunderstandings of the interface specifications.  The best way
to shake out such problems is by combining the interacting components
and exercising them together.  In planning the integration order of
components and functionality, we should ask when we will be able to
exercise each interfaces, which components need to be present (with
what level of functionality) to begin such exercising, and how we
will drive the testing.  The integration strategy should ensure that
as soon as two components are available, it will be possible to exercise
and observe their interactions.
</UL>
<P>
<H2>3. Integration and Scheduling</H2>
<P>
It is prudent to schedule riskier activities sooner.  If it is going
to take a while to get a tricky component right, starting it sooner
reduces the likelihood that those difficulties will cause us to miss
our schedule.  If we expect to encounter problems in the construction
of a new component, we have to be prepared to change our plans in
response to those problems.  Conducting those investigations up front
gives us the opportunity to change our designs before building the other
components that might be affected by those changes.  There may be other
reasons to schedule some components sooner than others (e.g. we plan
to use them as learning exercises, or they may require resources that
will not be available later).  The point is that external considerations
may determine the relative order in which some components are to be
built.
<P>
The product integration strategy must acommodate such requirements,
making it possible to integrate (giving them set of components with
which they can be combined) and test (providing a framework for exercising
them and observing their behavior) components in the order in which
their construction must be scheduled.
<P>
<H2>4. Integration and Architecture</H2>
<P>
The architecture of a system resolves its functionality into distinct
components, and defines the functions of each component, and the interfaces
between them.  When we talk about integration strategy, it is natural to
describe that strategy in terms of which components will be introduced,
in which order, with what subsets of their specified interfaces and
functionality.
<P>
When we define each component, we must consider:
<UL>
   <LI> how we would construct dummy versions of that component 
        that would permit complete systems to be built, even though 
        none of the components was actually complete.
   <LI> how the specified interfaces would enable us to drive
	unit test cases ... ideally with the component embedded
	in a complete system.
   <LI> how we would provide simple simulations of later components
	to enable earlier components to be tested as soon as possible.
   <LI> how we would determine who was at fault when new versions
	of multiple components interacted for the first time.
   <LI> the increments in which that component's functionality
        should be delivered, and how these should be phased with
	the functionality of other components in order to enable
	new features to be tested as soon as they are ready.
</UL>
<P>
The architecture of the system, and each of its sub-components must
be designed to support an integration strategy.  The integration
strategy dovetails a testing strategy with an implementation 
schedule.  The integration strategy is ultimately dictated by 
the schedule and the architecture.  
None of these can be designed without considering the others.  
<P>
As I have said may times before,
<strong>architecture is compromise</strong>.
