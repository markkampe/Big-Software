<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
<P>
The term <strong>post-mortem</strong> is latin for "after death", and
originally referred to a medical examination of a corpse to determine
the cause of death.  The term has, more colloquially come to refer to
any "after the fact" analysis and discussion of a recently completed
process or event, to see what lessons we can learn from it.  
<P>
Such analyses are have been going on for a very long time.  Five 
thousand years ago Egyptian doctors recorded wounds, treatments
and results to build up a body of knowledge about what did and did
not work. During the middle ages, engineers from all over Europe
would flock to the site of a collapsed cathedral to attempt to learn
lessons that would prevent similar fates from befalling their own
cathedrals.  Military strategists have long studied every battle
ever recorded so that they could learn lessons without having
to suffer defeats.
<P>
The above examples all seem focused on understanding
<em>what we did wrong</em> ... and historically (and
perhaps psychologically), failure has proven to be
one of our best teachers.  But we also want to learn from
our successes.  Every task we do can be an experiment where
we try new things.  Some experiments will not turn out the
way we had hoped, but some will turn out better than we
could have imagined.  In organizations that are serious about
getting better at their jobs, retrospective reviews are an
important part of every project.
<P>
<H2>2. Goals of a Post Mortem</h2>
<P>
The goals of a post mortem review are very simple:
<UL>
   <LI> To identify the things we did right, so that we can
	remember to try them again in similar situations.
   <LI> To note the things that should have been done differently,
	so that we can refine our techniques in the future.
   <LI> To note the things that we did wrong, and to suggest
	alternative approaches or safety measures that we should
	employ the next time we face a similar problem.
</UL>
<P>
Exploring what we did wrong is frightening ... and in some 
organizations it is dangerous.  If admitting having made
mistakes opens us to criticism or discipline, we are unlikely
to make such admissions.  This strategy is ultimately self-defeating,
since failing to understand a past mistake usually condemns us to
repeating it again in the future.  Organizations that are serious
about improvement understand this, and take trouble to create a
process and culture wherein it is safe to explore mistakes.
<P>
When we enter into a post-mortem process, we must all accept a
few basic premises:
<UL>
   <LI> Everybody tries to do their best, as best they understand it.
   <LI> We make our decisions in stressed situations, with imperfect
	information.
   <LI> We are often called upon to carry out tasks for which we have
	not been trained, with what-ever tools and resources happened
	to be at hand.
   <LI> Mistakes are inevitable in such situations.
   <LI> The goal of this process is not to find fault with any
	individual or their actions.  Rather it is to look at
	what happened and see what lessons we can learn from it.
   <LI> The output of this process will not be an assessment of
	any person or group of people, but rather an assessment
	of our processes, and how they can be improved.
</UL>
<P>
It is absolutely essential that everyone involved completely
accept this "no blame, we are here to learn model".  Many
organizations go to great trouble to create such safe environments.
The FAA, for instance, has an Aviation Safety Reporting System, 
whereby pilots who make "mistakes" can gain immunity from 
regulatory discipline if they report those incidents to the ASRS.
<P>
<H2>3. Process of a Post Mortem</h2>
<P>
In highly stressed environments, built up fear and anger may make
it very difficult to get people to discuss (or even to objectively
look at) a recent project.  In situations like this, the organization
may be in serious need of healing, and it may be
necessary to have the process managed by a professional facilitator.
In healthier settings, it may be "just another meeting" where
the goal is simply to gather opinions and formulate recommendations.  
The types of questions that should ultimately be explored are:
<OL type=1>
   <LI> What things turned out well, and why?
   <LI> What tools, techniques, and processes worked well, and why?
   <LI> What improvements would we make to them?
   <LI> What things turned out poorly, and why?
   <LI> What tools, techniques, and processes worked poorly, and why?
   <LI> What improvements would we make to them?
   <LI> What alternatives should we develop?
   <LI> What unexpected problems came up?
   <LI> What warning signs should we have noticed?
   <LI> What decisions could we have reasonably made differently?
   <LI> What still confuses or concerns us?
   <LI> How would we assess the success of this project?
   <LI> How would we assess the success of our tools, techniques, and processes?
   <LI> What are the few key recommendations we would make to management?
</OL>
<P>
Even in non-threatening environments, gathering this sort of input 
can be a delicate process.  It is important that everyone be given
the opportunity to speak, and that the meeting not be monopolized
by the people with the strongest opinions and loudest voices.  As
in brain-storming, the early phases should be non-critical:
<UL>
Let everyone contribute what-ever they think interesting.
<P>
You can talk about your own experiences, but you are not allowed
to comment on somebody else's experience.
</UL>
<P>
After we have given everybody the opportunity to express all of their
thoughts, we can then enter a second phase where we compare, combine,
sift, sort, and synthesize punch-lines out of the raw material developed
in the first phase.
<P>
People are often hesitant to complain about problems or concede
errors when their managers are present.  Thus, it is often a good
idea to conduct separate post-mortem for people at different levels
in the management hierarchy.  Higher level managers need the output
of the post-mortem process to make sure that the needed lessons are
learned.  It may actually be counter productive for the managers to
be present as people are exploring the events of the project.
<P>
<H3>3.1 Post Mortem Report</h3>
<P>
The process of conducting a post-mortem is, in many respects,
a brain-storming process.  Many ideas and issues will be explored,
and most of them will not prove worthy of capturing.  Explorations
of how things went wrong may be heated and/or cathartic ... but
publishing the details of those stories would be antithetical
to the goals of the process.
<P>
A Post Mortem report is not a compendium of stories that came
out in post mortem meetings.  All of those stories need to
be examined, reconciled, filtered, distilled, prioritized,
and synthesized into cogent punch-lines.
They then need to be organized into a few key points, with 
examples of problems that occurred and recommendations for 
how to deal with them in the future.
<P>
A good post-mortem report clearly describes problems, and
opportunities for improvement, and it does so without 
blaming people or rehashing heart-breaking stories.  In many
organizations, it is common for post-mortem reports to be
widely distributed, so that many people have the opportunity
to learn from every project.
<P>
<h2>4. Summary</h2>
<P>
There is no one best format or technique for post-mortem reviews,
and there is no authoritative list of questions to be explored.
Every organization has to evolve a post-mortem style that fits
in with their culture and mission.  Some may involve a weekend
of drum circles and trust exercises at a forest retreat, while 
others are just 30 minutes of prepared power-point presentations 
in the main conference room.
<P>
A good post-mortem meeting is any meeting where people honestly share
and explore their experiences with the intent of learning from
them and doing better next time.  Everything else is just a 
matter of style.
