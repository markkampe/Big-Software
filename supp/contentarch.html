<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
<P>
Algorithms, routines, and programs come into being as elaborations 
of an already conceived design.  That design may evolve
based on understandings we gain during its implementation, but we
cannot write even a single line of code until we have some 
conception of how the program will work.
The same can be said for data structures.  
We quickly form a sense of the key domain objects and their
properties and relationships to one another, and this guides
even our earliest design and implementation efforts.
The design of application objects, and the underlying data 
structures and algorithms are well taught in computer science courses.
<P>
The advent of HTML, browsers, and the world wide web has given rise 
to new (and very different) classes of application that are more dominated
by content (information to be displayed) than 
functionality (services to be performed).  
Because web sites are so easy to build, 
they often start out as an assembly of content, 
whose structure is added in afterwards.
For simple web sites, this may be an economical prototyping approach.  
For more complex web sites, 
it can result in poor usability and considerable rework.
<P>
The same skills that we apply to develop a system architecture
can be (very profitably) applied to the task of structuring 
content-rich applications.
This paper is intended as a superficial introduction to the emerging 
disciplines of <strong>Content Modeling</strong>, 
and <strong>Relationship</strong> 
and <strong>Navigation Analysis</strong>.
<P>
In this paper, I will use the term "application" rather than "web site" 
to describe the things we are designing, 
because the principles apply equally to any content-rich application, 
whether it is implemented via HTTP/HTML or code and GUI.
<P>

<H2>2. Content Models</h2>
<P>
We begin by defining what the "content" portion of our
application is.  There are two general approaches to this
problem:
<UL>
   <LI> enumerate all of the various types of document, images,
        audio, etc, that will be accessible through this
	application.
   <LI> look at the user' world-view (as described in the use
	cases and user interviews) and describe the implied
	hierarchy of user-visible objects.
</UL>
<P>
These two approaches are actually high complementary, with the
former approach generating a list of content that must be 
accommodated and the latter generating a structure into which
it can be organized.  Elaborating this model (e.g. as a UML
class model) will bring us to a better understanding of the 
various content-subtypes, and the attributes associated with each.
Note, however, that there may not be a simple one-to-one mapping
between content-subtypes and user-view objects.  In such cases,
it is critical that the mapping from user-view to specific content
items be well defined.
<P>
The content model should be reviewed:
<UL>
   <LI> by the intended users, to ensure that it matches their
	world view, and satisfies their expectations.
   <LI> by the content providers, to ensure that it encompasses
	all of the content they are intending/able to provide.
   <LI> by domain experts, to ensure that it reasonably captures
	the key attributes of each content object.
</UL>

<H2>3. Relationship Analysis</h2>
<P>
The next step is to map out <strong>all</strong> of the relationships 
among objects in the content model.
Many of these relationships will be obvious
(aggregation, composition, and direct reference).  
Other associations may not be obvious from the basic class
hierarchy, but may be implied by use cases 
(e.g. the ability to get from a customer to any order that customer
has submitted).
<P>
Relationships among obvious application domain objects 
(e.g. items in a sales catalog) are not difficult to map.  
For some content, however, the structuring relationships may
be less clear cut (e.g. how we might organize music or
family pictures).  In such cases we must look for inherent
sub-classes (e.g. musical pieces in the same genere, or by
the same performers), or we may even have to make up an
organizational structure (e.g. vacation pictures by trip,
family pictures by event, etc).  What ever axes we choose
to sub-class our content and establish interconnections must
make sense in the world view of our intended users.
<P>
This process may lead to the breaking up of composite objects into
distinct sub-pieces, or the creation of new association classes to
represent non-obvious relationships.  Each of these must have a
rational mapping into the users' world view.
The result of this process will be a richer version of the content
model, which must again be reviewed.
<P>
Once we have (what we believe to be) a fairly complete model of
the content objects and their relationships, what remains is to
propose the mechanisms by which the implied object hierarchy will
be navigated.
<H2>4. Navigation Analysis</h2>
<P>
Deciding how users will navigate the object hierarchy breaks down
into two (largely independent) sub-analyses:
<OL type=1>
   <LI> which relationships are users likely to need to traverse,
	how often, and under what circumstances?
   <LI> what user-interface widgetry should we use to 
	represent and implement each traversal?
</OL>
<H3>4.1 Understanding Navigational Requirements</h3>
<P>
Some objects will be primary entry points into the hierarchy:
<UL>
   <LI> the user interface might start out at such an entry-point.
   <LI> the user interface might include some widget (e.g. a
	selection item, menu, or drop-down list) from which primary 
	entry-point objects can be selected at any time.
   <LI> it might be possible to select primary objects based
	on specified search criteria, and the user interface
	might include a search window or some other obvious
	widget for entering search criteria.
</UL>
We must identify which objects are the primary points of entry
into the content hierarchy, and the general manner in which the
desired object can be chosen (e.g. range of valid search criteria).
<P>
Just as some objects will be viewed as primary, so will some
interconnections.  From our use-case scenarios, or perhaps
just from our understanding of the object model, we can identify
some relationships that we expect to be traversed "all the time".
These must be recognized so that we can give them a clear
visual representation, and a traversal mechanism that involves
a minimum amount of user effort (e.g. a short mouse movement
and single button click).
<P>
Other interconnections will be designated as being secondary (not all 
the time, but regularly) or tertiary (only used in exceptional situations).  
Knowing that a relationship is tertiary gives us the latitude to 
represent it in a less obtrusive way (thus reducing visual clutter)
or to require more elaborate interaction in order to traverse it.
<P>
Note that in this process, we may find that we create new
objects, relationships, and navigational requirements.  
Suppose that a search can return a long list of objects
(e.g. recipies).  We will need a way to browse that list 
(forward or backwards in large or small increments) as well 
as a means to select desired recipies.  Thus, even if we
didn't consider "list of returned recipies" as an class in
our original model, that class might well emerge as an 
artifact of decisions about how to select and navigate a
large database of recipies.
<P>
<H3>4.2 Selecting Navigational Idioms</h3>
<P>
The available navigational idioms (links, tabs, action bars,
right-click menus, etc.) may be fundamentally constrained by 
our user interface technology, and further limited by the 
basic User Interface design.  The selected user interface
technology and toolkit will support only certain types of
widgets, and our choices are limited to these.  There may
also be a higher level product style-guide that dictates
whether we should use (for instance) tabs, menus, or action bars.
<P>
From the available widgets:
<UL>
   <LI> some may involve only a mouse click in the
	active region of the screen.
   <LI> some may involve moving the cursor to another
	area of the screen and clicking a choice.
   <LI> some may involve interacting with menu systems.
   <LI> some may involve multi-step navigation
   <LI> some may involve complex dialogs (themselves involving
	entering information and making selections).
</UL>
For each object, and for each traversable relationship from
that object, we must define the widgetry through which the
user will be enabled to traverse that link.
<P>
The quicker and more central mechanisms should be used for the
most commonly followed paths.  The peripheral mechanisms may be
better suited for less common actions and relationships.  More
obscure and complex interactions should be reserved for exceptional
situations.  It is not sufficient, however, to merely assign
widgets to relationships in a way that minimizes hand motion.
If the proposed user interface is to be learnable, there must
be a consistent set of principles that determine which types
of relationships are mapped onto which types of widgets.
In similar situations, users should be presented with similar
options with similar placements and representations.
Consistentcy of organization, metatphor, placement, and presentation
make a system much easier to learn and use.
In all cases we must ask whether or not it will be
obvious to the user what is options are, and how to accomplish
all reasonable (at this juncture) objectives.
<P>
We must also consider how the user can reverse each decision,
or recover from an accidental mis-choice at any juncture.
It would be unfortunate if <strong>one</strong> misplaced 
mouse-click could result in data loss, or necessitated a
long and complex series of interactions to get back to
the place where the error was made.
Sometimes, the answer may be to do all navigation on a
stack, and to provide a "back" operation to return you
to the previous state and contents.  We may decide that
a stack only makes sense for a few relationships, but we
still have to consider how a user will be able to recover
from mistakes like following the wrong link.
<P>
<H2>5. Conclusions</h2>
<P>
We use methodology to guide us through processes that are too
complex or critical to be trusted to chance.  A content-rich application
whose content parallels an obvious world-view will be easier to understand.  
Navigation that has been designed with consideration
for the full range of relationships, and the manner in which users are
likely to want to traverse them is likely to be more convenient and intuitive.
<P>
The application of content modeling, and relationship and navigation
analysis to such problems can help us to reliably achieve these goals.

Relationship Navigation Analysis is a much richer field than is implied
by the simple suggestions made above.  A (non-trivial) introduction to
the richer subject can be found in a 2000 paper by Yoo and Bieber,
