<H2> Interface Specifications</h2>
<P>
American History books like to credit Eli Whitney with the invention
of manufacturing with interchangeable parts.  Actually, 
<UL>
   <LI> Whitney's parts weren't all that interchangeable, 
   <LI> he got the idea from a French gunsmith (Honore Blanc), 
   <LI> the Swedish clock maker Christopher Polhem did a much 
	better job with clock gears 50 years earlier.  
</UL>
But, be that as it may, interchangeable parts revolutionized, 
and in fact enabled modern manufacturing.
The underlying concept is that there be specifications for every part.
If each part is manufactured and measured to be within its specifications,
then <strong>any</strong> collection of these parts can be assembled 
into a working whole.  This greatly reduces the cost and difficulty
of building a working system out of component parts.
<P>
The same principle applies to software.  If you want to open a file
on a Posix system, you use the <strong>open</strong> system call.  
There may be a hundred different implementations of open but
this doesn't matter because they all conform to the same interface 
specification.  The rewards for this standardization are:
<OL type=a>
   <LI> Your work as a programmer is simplified, because you
	don't have to write your own file I/O routines.
   <LI> Your program is likely to be easily portable to any
	Posix compliant system, because they all provide
	the same file I/O services.
   <LI> Training time for new programmers is reduced, because
	everybody already knows how to use the Posix file
	I/O functions.
</OL>
<H2>The Criticality of Interfaces in Architecture</h2>
<P>
A system architecture defines the major components of the system,
the functionality of each, and the interfaces between them.  
Clearly the component interface specifications are a critical element
of any architecture.  To the extent that these interfaces have been
well considered and well defined, it should be possible to (at least semi)
independently design and implement those components.  In principle, any 
implementations that satisfy those functional and interface specifications 
should combine to yield a working system.
<P>
The converse is also true.  To the extent that interfaces between 
components were poorly considered or specified, it becomes unlikely
that independently developed components will work when combined
together, and more likely that subsequent changes to one component
will break others.
<P>
<H2>The Importance of Interface Stability</h2>
<P>
We write contracts is so that everybody knows what
will be expected of them, and what they can expect from the other
parties to the agreement.  Everybody will depend on you to uphold
your obligations under the contract.  A software interface specification
is a form of contract:
<UL>
   <LI> the contract describes an interface and the associated
	functionality.
   <LI> implementation providers agree that their systems will
	conform to the specification.
   <LI> developers agree to limit their use of the functionality
	to what is described in the interface specification.
</UL>
And in return for this they get all the benefits described above.
<P>
Suppose that some architectural genius realized that Posix file
semantics are too weak to describe the behavior of files in a
distributed system, and that this could be solved by adding a
new (required) parameter (for a call-back routine) to the Posix
open call.  What would happen?
<UL>
   <LI> software written to the new semantics would have access
	to richer behavior, and would function better in cases
	of node and network failures.
   <LI> software written to the new semantics would not work on
	other Posix compliant systems.
   <LI> software written to the old semantics would not work on
	the new systems.
   <LI> customers (knowing nothing about this techno-feud) 
	would be faced with inexplicable failures, and
	would start complaining to their software and system
	providers (none of whom were responsible for the change).
   <LI> programmers would be confused about which version of open
	they were using, and would probably get around the problem
	by writing their own file I/O packages ... a bunch of extra
	work, but at least it would protect them from future such
	acts of mischief.
</UL>
And as a result of this, we would lose all of the benefits described
above.  When you promise somebody that you will do something (e.g.
conform to a specified interface), 
and they depend on you (e.g. by writing code to that interface), 
and you don't follow through (e.g. make an incompatible change) ... 
problems are likely to ensue (e.g. failures, bug reports, product
gets a bad reputation, going out of business, etc.).
<P>
<H2>Program vs. User Interfaces</h2>
<P>
Human beings are amazingly robust.  We could change the text in
dialog boxes, rearrange input forms, add new required input
items, and rework all of the menus in a program, and many users
would figure out the changes in a few seconds.  
This inclines many developers to be cavalier in making changes to 
user interfaces.
<P>
Code is nowhere nearly so robust. If I expect my second parameter
to be a file name, and you pass me the address of a call-back routine
instead, the best we can hope for is a good error message and a
quick coredump with no data corruption.
<P>
If all users were developers, and only ran their own code, this might
be just an irritation.  We would get the core dump, track it down,
figure out that some idiot had made this change, recode accordingly,
and an hour later we'd be good as new.  Unfortunately most people 
run code that they do not understand, and have no way to debug or
fix.  If a program breaks, all I can do is call support and complain.
I am helpless.  Users don't care which programmer goofed up.  
"I bought your product.  It doesn't work.  I'm taking my business
elsewhere!".
<P>
If you are going to be delivering binary software to non-developers
(that describes 99.999% of all software) you have to trust that
what ever platform they run it on will correctly implement all of
the interfaces on which your program depends.
<P>
The same argument applies, tho not quite as strongly, to independent
components in a single system.  If components exchange services, and
I make an incompatible change to the interfaces of one component, this
has the potential to break other components in the same system.  I can
fix the other components in our system to work with the new changes
but:
<UL>
   <LI> this complicates the making of the change.
   <LI> we have to ensure that mis-matched component sets are impossible.
</UL>
<P>
<H2>Is every interface graven in stone?</H2>
<P>
Absolutely not.
<P>
You are free to add features that do not change the interface
specification (a faster or more robust implementation).  In
many cases you can add upwards-compatible extensions (all old
programs will still work the same way, but new interfaces enable
new software to access new functionality).
<P>
If the only code that uses my routines is code that I deliver,
and I deliver it all in a single package, then I can change
my interface at any time.
<UL>
   <LI> customers who have an old package will have the old
	version of my routine, and all of the code in that
	package will work with the old routine.
   <LI> customers who install the new package will simultaneously
	get a new version of my routine <strong>and</strong>
	new versions of all the code that calls it.
</UL>
But the problem with this is that nobody else is allowed to use
my routine.
<P>
Another approach would be to send out (to all developers who want
to use my routine) an implementation, that they could incorporate
into their own products.  Later, if I came up with an improved
version, I could send that out to all of my developers.
<UL>
   <LI> products written to the old specs would still have an
	old version of the routine, and simply wouldn't take
	advantage of my new version.
   <LI> newer products, that wanted to take advantage of my
	new version, could include the new version along with
	their programs.
</UL>
<P>
It is OK to change interfaces, as long as you can ensure that
all clients of the interface will be changed at the same time.
It is only when the described module can be delivered independently 
from the software that uses it that we get into trouble.
You simply have to make a choice:
<UL>
   <LI> if you want to be able to change an interface at will,
	you also have to have control over all of the software
	that uses the interface.
   <LI>	if you want to provide an interface to unbundled software
	(software that can be changed independently) then you
	must maintain interface stability.
</UL>
<P>
This is a very painful problem, because it would seem to suggest
that you have to choose between customer disruption and stifling
innovation.  Fortunately it is not binary.  There is a continuum of
stabilities:
<UL>
   <LI> guaranteed for ever
   <LI> guaranteed for the life of this product
   <LI> guaranteed x months of notice before any incompatible change
   <LI> access by special arrangement, which will enable us to
	manage potentially disruptive changes
   <LI> caveat emptor
</UL>
<P>
How stable an interface needs to be depends on how you intend
to use it.  What is important is that:
<OL type=1>
   <LI> we be honest about our intentions and set realistic expectations.
   <LI> we have a plan for how we will manage change.
</OL>
<H2>Interface Stability and Design</h2>
<P>
So, if we want to expose an interface to unbundled software
with high quality requirements, we are not allowed to change 
it in non-upwards-compatible ways.  
That sounds like a bother, but if that is the rules, so be it.
What has this got to do with architecture and design?
<P>
When we design a system, and the interfaces between the independent
components, we need to consider all of the different types of change
that are likely to happen over the life of this system.  When we 
specify our external component interfaces we need to have high
confidence that will be able to accomodate all of the envisioned
evolution while preserving those interfaces.
<UL>
   <LI> We might rearrange the distribution of functionality
	between components to create a simpler (and hence
	more preservable) interface between them.
   <LI> We might design features that we may never implement,
	just to make sure that the specified interfaces will
	accomodate them if we ever do decide to build them.
   <LI> We might introduce (seemingly) unnatural degrees of
	abstraction in our services to ensure that they
	leave us enough slack for future changes.
</UL>
We must consider which of our interfaces will need to be how stable,
and design our system with those stabilities in mind.
