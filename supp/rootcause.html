A man was walking by the side of a river and saw an
out-of-breath woman swiming out to rescue a baby floating
in the river.  There were a half dozen babies already on the
shore and she screamed for him to help her save them.  
He turned and started running upstream.  She shouted 
"you must help me save these babies!"  He shouted back 
"I'm going to go find the person who is throwing them 
in the river!".

You find a bug, you fix it, and you move on to the next bug.
Right?  What do you do if you figure out that most of your
bugs are coming from a single person or process?  
Wouldn't it be more efficient to fix the broken person or
process than to continue fixing their bugs?  Tolstoy may 
have been right about every unhappy family being unique,
but it is regularly observed that a great many bugs seem to 
be traceable to a few common causes.  There are many such
lists but a few common ones are:
<UL>
   <LI> off-by-one errors</LI>
   <LI> confusion over names</LI>
   <LI> array/buffer overflows</LI>
   <LI> incorrect handling of error conditions</LI>
   <LI> failure to free memory</LI>
   <LI> reuse of deallocated pointers</LI>
   <LI> race conditions in parallel code paths</LI>
</UL>
<P>
It is important to realize that these are not random
mistakes resulting from cosmic-ray hits to programmer
neurons.  These are systematic mistakes resulting from
incomplete understanding and/or unsound processes. 
McConnell's "Code Complete" is an effort to address
many of the most common and troublesome of these problems.
But even if we fully mastered all of these lessons, we would
merely go on to find new mistakes to make.

<strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong>
is a critical element of most 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process">continuous improvement</a>
methodologies.  A few notions underlie this process:
<UL>
   <LI> process changes are expensive, and we should only
	make changes when we have good reason to believe
	that the benefits will greatly exceed the costs.</LI>
   <LI> errors are not random, but stem from specific causes.</LI>
   <LI> there are chains of causality, and by following them
	backwards, we can find common causes to problems that
	(initially) seemed to be unrelated.</LI>
   <LI> the Pareto principle applies to errors, in that 20%
	of the causes, give rise to 80% of the problems.</LI>
   <LI> eliminating the source of many errors has
	the potential to be much more effective than finding
	and eliminating individual error instances.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
There are many approaches to root cause analysis.  Some 
(e.g. <A Href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_Sigma>6 Sigma</a>) 
are rich formal methodologies,
while others 
(e.g. <A Href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys>5 Whys</a>) 
are simple enough to be driven by a four-year old.  
Most of them, however, involve:
<UL>
   <LI> (statistical or annectodal) analysis to identify clusters of related
	problems or attributes that are shared by large numbers
	of problems.</LI>

   <LI> investigation of representative instances (by domain experts)
	to follow the chain of causality back to a <strong>root</strong> cause.</LI>

   <LI> additional studies to confirm that this root cause did indeed
	significantly contribute to a great many problems.</LI>

   <LI> identify changes to eliminate or control this root cause.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
A root cause might be in our process, our materials, the training
of our people, the type of product we are building, the way we
identify potential customers, or any other aspect of our operation.  
Root cause analysis does not presume where the roots of the problem 
will be found.
<P>
We might, for example, start with the observation that we are 
having a great many security penetration incidents.
<UL>
   <LI> A study of these incidents might reveal that 99% were 
	achieved through privileged network daemons.</LI>
   <LI> A more detailed study of these incidents might reveal 
	that only 5% were classified as design problems, and 
	that over 85% were classified as coding problems.</LI>
   <LI> A review of the code found that 95% of the incidents
	characterized as coding problems, involved overflows of
	local (on the stack) buffers.</LI>
   <LI> The stack is the most popular target because overflowing an
	array on the stack permits an attacker to change the return 
	address and thus to execute arbitrary code.</LI>
   <LI> People put input buffers on the stack because it is easier
	than doing dynamic memory allocation.</LI>
   <LI> Most of the overflows result from reading until a delimiter
	is found, without regard to the accumulated length.</LI>
   <LI> The programmers made these mistakes because they were never
	told to watch out for them.  The code passed review for the
	same reason.</LI>
</UL>
We might consider the last few of these to be root causes of hundreds of
penetration bugs.  Once we have identified a few causes that explain
a large number of problems, we can set about attacking those causes:
<UL>
   <LI> we could start working on a prototype study for an auditing 
	utility to identify code that puts arrays on the stack and
	does not appear to have adequate bounds checking.</LI>
   <LI> we could study the offending code and attempt to define a
	new library package to provide more convenient buffer 
	access functions (a) in dynamically allocated memory
	(b) with automatic bounds checking.</LI>
   <LI> we could add bounds checking to our mandatory issues list
	for all code reviews for privileged programs and network daemons.</LI>

</UL>
<P>
Sometimes, as Sigmund Freud once conceded,
<em>a cigar is just a cigar</em>.  We should, however, stop periodically,
look at what we are doing, and attempt to ascertain whether some of the
problems we are fighting might more effectively be addressed closer to the
source:
<UL>
    <LI> When we find a bug that seems to be the result of a misunderstanding
         or confusion about how to properly use some resource or method, we
	 should always ask whether or not the same mistake (<em>similar bugs</em>)
	 might be present elsewhere in the same body of code.  In my experience
	 this has often proved to be the case ... but recognizing the details
	 of the misunderstanding often makes those other instances very easy to find.</li>
    <li> If the misunderstanding (or carelessness) seems to be (like the above
         example) more fundamental, it may be appropriate to raise the issue
	 (to the entire team) as a potential <em>root cause</em> that might
	 be best addressed by changes to our education and procedures.</li>
</UL>
