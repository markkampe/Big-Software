<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
<P>
One of the greatest books ever written on the subject of strategy
begins:
<UL>
Sun Tzu said:  The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
<br>
It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin.  
<br>
Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.
</UL>
<P>
The same thing can be said of software project estimation.
Estimates are a pre-condition for any non-trivial software
project, in that time and cost are key considerations in
deciding whether or not to pursue a project.
Good estimates lay the foundation for successful projects,
by identifying the required resources and enabling us to
predict how long it will take to develop the required
functionality.  Bad estimates can ensure the failure of
a project ... if it cannot be built with the assigned resources,
or cannot be delivered within the required time frame.

If we are to be successful at software construction, we must
develop skill at software project estimation.
Unfortunately, as another great commentator on the human 
condition (Yogi Berra) once observed ...
<UL>
	Predictions are tough, particularly when they involve the future.
</UL>
<P>
Project estimation involves many imponderables:
<UL>
	<LI> We may not be entirely sure what the rquirements are,
		and hence the scope of the problem to be solved.
	<LI> We aren't sure what we will wind up building, 
		and hence how big it will be.
	<LI> We aren't sure how we are going to build it,
		and hence what difficulties may arrise in the process.
	<LI> We aren't sure what resources will be available 
		(and hence what skills they will have) or when
		(which gates when the work can begin).
	<LI> We don't know what other distractions will arrise, and
	    	prevent those resources from being fully applied to
		this problem.
</UL>
These simple facts alone would seem to preclude the possibility of 
accurate estimates.  Because the preparation of estimates is so 
difficult, the results so disappointing, and the consequences so
dire, estimation is an activity that most developers and managers
avoid like the plague.  
While accurate predictions of the future are not generally possible,
there are techniques that can help us to make reasonable predictions
about the work that will be required to build a piece of software.
Because of the importance and difficulty of estimation, the study
of these techniques is a subject of inquiry, which can on no
account be neglected.

<H2>2. Principles of Estimation</h2>
<P>
There are numerous tools and techniques for estimating the size
of a software task, and numerous books written about each.  
More important, however, are a few basic principles that should 
guide all estimation efforts.
<P>
<H3>2.1 Estimates are not Guesses</h3>
<P>
They are the result of an analytical
process.  The quality of the estimate is determined by the 
sophistication and diligence with which the analysis is performed.  
Better (deeper and more methodical) analysis inevitably yields better estimates.
Your skill in analyzing projects and preparing estimates will improve
with experience and study.
<P>
Estimates are based on knowledge and data: an understanding of the project
to be undertaken, and about previous experience with the same team, tools,
and methodology.  The more complete your understanding of a project, the better
will be your estimates.  If you have access to data on the productivity of 
a team, on various problems, using various tools, this will enable you to
make better predictions about their productivity on the next project.
Data you collect on this project will help you with future projects.
<P>
<H3>2.2 Estimates are neither Precise or Deterministic</h3>
<P>
Because we do not have complete knowledge, it is not possible to
accurately predict how long it will take to complete a project.
Because of this uncertainty, an estimate is not a number, but rather
a probability density function.  The confidence estimates are every
bit as important as the time estimates ... and so they must be included
along with the estimate.
<UL>
In the early stages of project inception, crude estimates that might be off
by a power of ten may be entirely acceptable.  
<P>
By the time resources are being committed, it may be important for estimates 
to be correct to within 5-10%.
</UL>
<P>
If, in preparing an estimate, you find areas where uncertainty
is unacceptably high, these are the areas on which you need to focus
more effort and reduce your ignorance:
<UL>
    <LI> seek opinions from people with more experience in this area
    <LI> do research on the problems and approaches
    <LI> elaborate the design to gain a better understanding of the
	 proposed solution
    <LI> construct models and prototypes to explore potential problems
	 and approaches.
</UL>
<P>
Estimates should be regularly revisited and refined
to monitor the progress of the project, and update our predictions
of when we expect it to complete.
As investigations, plans, and implementations proceed, unknowns will
be resolved, probability functions will collapse, and the estimates
should converge.  
If the estimates do not converge, but rather continue to move outwards,
this is a warning sign that something is very wrong.
<P>
<H3>2.3 Estimate at the lowest possible level of detail</h3>
<P>
A single estimate for a 20 staff-year project could easily be high
or low by a power of ten.
An estimate for a 50 line routine will probably be accurate to within an hour:
<UL>
    <LI> smaller tasks are better defined and leave room for less doubt
    <LI> smaller tasks are simpler and more easily envisioned
    <LI> estimates for smaller tasks can be easily sub-contracted
	 out to groups or individuals with expertise in that particular area.
    <LI> the work to decompose a large project into smaller sub-tasks
         tends to expose tasks and problems that might not have been
	 obvious when the project was being viewed at a higher
	 level of abstraction.
    <LI> the work to decompose a large project into smaller sub-tasks
	 will tend to resolve many issues that were unclear when the
	 project was being viewed at a higher level of abstraction
</UL>
The result is that bottom-up estimates (summing the estimates for
all of the sub-tasks) are inevitably more accurate than 
whole-project estimates.  
Not only are the individual sub-task
estimates more accurate, but the enumeration of tasks to be performed
is more complete and the errors in these smaller estimates
tend to cancel out.
<P>
Hierarchical decomposition of a problem is a rational process for
exploring its difficulty, but it can lead to false confidence. 
Not unlike contemplating chess moves, each successive step takes
us further out onto hypothetical limbs, where expanding sets
of unknowns may make it difficult to accurately assess the
envisioned situations ... casting ever-greater doubt on the 
validity of the resulting assessments.
<P>
The SCRUM process recognizes and attmpts to address these dangers by:
<ul>
   <li>	declining to recognize the validity of any task that
	cannot be completed in a small number of staff days.
	SCRUM holds that anything larger than that is too big
	to be clearly understood.
   <li>	declining to make commitments that extend farther than 
	the current sprint (whose contents are small, well defined, 
	and well understood).  As we gaze farther into the future
	our understanding of the required work becomes cloudy, 
	making estimates untrustworthy.
   <li>	continuously <em>grooming</em> the backlog:
	refining the task list, descriptions, and estimates.
	As these stabilize, our estimates of a completion
	date (based on estimated points and velocity) begin
	to converge.
</ul>
<P>
<H3>2.4 Get Multiple Independent Estimates</h3>
<P>
There are many approaches to estimating the size of a project:
<UL>
   <LI> Highly interactive projects can often be estimated based on the
        number of specified use cases.
   <LI> Given an architecture, we can attempt to estimate the
	size of each component.
   <LI> If we have worked on similar projects, we can attempt
	to assess the relative difficulty of this one, and to
	estimate the size delta relative to other benchmark
	projects.
   <LI> Object oriented implementations can often be estimated 
        based on the number and richness of classes.
   <LI> Given a component design, we can attempt to estimate
	the number of required lines of code or Function Points.
</UL>
Different techniques are appropriate to different projects at
different stages of specification ... but each of these techniques
yields a completely independent assessment of how much work will
be involved.
<P>
Different people have had different experiences.  When they look
at a project description, they will see different problems, and
different approaches.  Assessments from different sources can
points, use cases, comparisons to past projects).
<P>
If 3-5 independent estimates cluster well, you can feel good about
the estimate.  If estimates are widely scattered there are two
possible explanations:
<UL>
    <LI> the problem is not yet well enough understood or specified
    <LI> some of the estimators or estimation techniques are ill
	 suited to this problem.
</UL>
<P>
Which ever the cause, a group discussion about the disputed
estimates usually resolves the question quickly.  If the diversity
of opinion results from an inadequate understanding of the problem,
the answer is additional research, design, or prototyping.  If
the diversity results from the application of an inappropriate
estimation technique, find better ones.
<P>
<h3>2.5 Be Honest and Clear</h3>
<P>
Do the best analysis you can to develop your estimates.
Projects that begin with estimates that are slanted to
bolster some agenda, or to tell the executives what they want
to hear usually end badly.  The best decisions are the ones
that are based on the best possible data.  A project that
begins with a bad estimate is on the road to ruin.
<P>
Executives will want to know what the bottom line is.
When can I have it and how much is it going to cost?  
Clearly state your assumptions, and make sure that you 
always give your times and costs within a confidence band.
If they tell you that a confidence band is too wide, you
need to be prepared to suggest investigations to
reduce that uncertainty.
<P>
Management will almost certainly "push back" on your estimates,
telling you that they are too high.  
<strong>Don't get defensive!</strong>
Be prepared to explain the
process you used to develop your estimates, the data sources on 
which you drew, the confirmation that you obtained, and how
much confidence you have.  Project size estimates can often
be reduced by changing the project requirements, scope, design,
methodology, or understanding of the problem.  
Making a number smaller simply because an executive
thinks it is too large is self deception (and unlikely to end well).
<P>

<H2>3 Summary</h2>
<P>
Estimation is difficult, messy, and does not admit of closed form
(or even correct) solutions.  
This does not, however, mean that estimation methodology
is futile or that all estimates are equally bad.  People who take
project estimation seriously will find their efforts rewarded.
During the age of exploration (when the proceeds of expeditions
had to be divided among investors) anyone who could do long 
division found that his career was made.  Today, when so much
value is created by successful software projects, the same can
be said about someone who can do project estimation.
