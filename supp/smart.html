<H1>Characteristics of Good Milestones</H1>

<P>
One key element of a project schedule is the creation of 
<strong>milestones</strong>.  
A literal milestone is a stone marker, 
set (at regular intervals) along the side of a road,
 to assure travelers that they are still on the right path 
and to show them how far they have progressed along that path
(e.g. the distance to Rome).
Project milestones are very similar: accomplishments that 
measure our progress towards completion.  
<P>
A project plan will define a set of milestones, and
specify a date, by which each milestone
is expected to be achieved.  We will take status reports from
all of the people on the project, and compare them with the
established project milestones ... to ensure that everyone
is working on the right tasks and making progress at the
expected rate.  These comparisons enable us to detect
and respond to problems as quickly as possible.
Well chosen milestones are key to effective project management.
<P>
The most obvious way to define project milestones is to break the
project down into sub-components and tasks, and to define a milestone 
for the completion of each sub-component.  These might or might not 
prove to be a good set of milestones.  
There are a set of characteristics that
good milestones should have.  They should be:
<UL>
  <LI> Specific
  <LI> Measurable
  <LI> Achievable
  <LI> Relevant
  <LI> Timely
</UL>

<H2>Specific</h2>
<P>
A good milestone is <strong>specific</strong>.  There should be no ambiguity
about what it means.  A vague goal might be something like "sufficient 
functionality for alpha testing".  A more specific goal might be
"able to perform searches by artist, album, and title".
<P>

<H2>Measurable</h2>
<P>
A good milestone is <strong>measurable</strong>.  This means that
(a)the goal should be quantitative (or at least quantifiable) and
(b) that there must be an objective process for measuring its achievement.
<P>
We could define a milestone for the completion of a module ... but
how does one measure completion?  People often attempt to define
completion by a sign-off (e.g. from some manager).  The obtaining
of a sign-off is indeed specific and measurable ... but what acceptance
criteria should the signer use?  These criteria should be clearly
specified and independently ascertainable.  A more quantitative and
meaningful milestone might be the successful execution of all 35 of
the specified unit test cases.
<P>

<H2>Achievable</h2>
<P>
A good milestone is entirely <strong>achievable</strong>.  
Stretch goals are a good thing, but unachievable requirements
are counter-productive.
Sometimes, in an effort to encourage people to do their best, 
project managers set impractical goals (e.g. "100,000 hours
of beta testing" or "zero open bugs").  Setting impractical
requirements (a) ensures failure and (b) actually demotivates
the team.
<P>
There is, of course, also a danger of setting the bar too low,
and shipping a product that is only marginally acceptable.  
One way of addresing this problem is to establish a points
system for capabilities, and minimum required scores for every
attribute ... but to require a total score greater than the sum 
of the minimums.
<P>

<H2>Relevant</h2>
<P>
A good milestone is <strong>directly related</strong> 
to the achieving of project goals.
We could define a milestone for having written 2000 lines of code ...
but if that code does not yet work, or if it does not deliver a complete
unit of functionality, it is difficult to correlate this milestone to
progress.  A much better milestone might be successful completion of
a code review.
As a general rule, it is better to measure progress with results 
achieved than with
effort expended ... which leads to <strong>earned value analysis</strong>.
<P>
Direct relevance is, in fact, a common problem with all kinds of 
goal setting (not merely the definition of project milestones).
Some customer support organizations, for instance, measure their
productivity with metrics like "number of cases closed" and "mean
time to closure" ... which motivates support staff to close problem
reports as quickly as possible, whether the underlying problems are
solved or not.  Unfortunately, such behavior may not directly correlate
to the real goals of solving problems and satisfying customers.
<P>

<H2>Timely</h2> 
<P>
A primary purpose of milestones is to measure progress.  
To fulfill this purpose, they must be spaced at reasonable intervals.
How many milestones are need, and how closely spaced they are depends
on the situation:
<UL>
<LI> If I were managing very junior people, I might want to see
daily milestones ... to enable me to closely monitor their
progress and quickly detect problems.
<LI> If I were managing more senior people, I might want to see
only weekly milestones ... to enable me to generally monitor progress,
while minimizing the overhead of reporting.
<LI> If I were reporting on the status of a large project to a
customer, we would probably talk in terms of major project milestones
that could be many months apart.
