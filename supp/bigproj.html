<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
<P>
The fact that you are taking an upper division computer science course, 
means that you have successfully completed thousands of assignments and 
(at least) dozens of significant projects.  This attests to your
intelligence, skill, dedication, and resourcefulness: the characteristics 
that get us through 1-100 hour tasks.  You are about to start confronting
larger tasks ... senior projects, clinic, graduate research, or in the
software development industry.  The complexities and risks associated with
a project grow geometrically with its size.  As you move into larger
projects, you will discover that individual ability becomes a weaker
predictor of success, and that methodology becomes more critical.
<P>
This course is about the issues and approaches, methodologies, tools,
and techniques for successfully pursuing large software projects.
This paper is a brief introduction to project management 1A.  
You might be tempted to
say (or at least to hope) that project management is the responsibility
of career managers, and it will be years (if ever) before you have to
confront those problems.  Were it only so!  If you go into industry,
and you are very lucky, you will have the opportunity to work for skilled
and well seasoned managers.  Unfortunately a few other things will happen
first:
<UL>
   <LI> What skilled manager is going to plan and direct your projects
	in this class?
   <LI> What skilled manager is going to plan and direct your senior
	thesis/clinic/project?
   <LI> What skilled manager is going to plan and direct your graduate
	research?<br>
	Oh really?  What management training and experience has your 
	thesis advisor had?
   <LI> Even if you find yourself in industry, what makes you think
	that a skilled and experienced project manager will be doing
	1st level line management?  You will often find yourself
	working for people who have little more (or even less) 
	project management experience than you.
</ul>
<P>
To be successful in such situations will require you to possess a basic
understanding of project management.  Conversely, having such skills
will do much to ensure your success ... even if you never move into
management.  This following chapters will discuss the basics of:
<UL>
   <LI>	forming teams and partitioning work
   <LI> scheduling work
   <LI> monitoring progress and dealing with problems
</UL>
Most of these subjects will be revisited in, in more detail, in future
lectures, but most of those lectures are at the end of the semester, and
you will need to start using these skills immediately.
In the words of a great teacher:
<UL>
Powerful allies, these tools are.<br>
Use them.<br>
Serve you, they will.<br>
</UL>

<H2>2. Project Teams</h2>
<P>
Based on our experiences with team projects at school, it might seem
natural to infer that we assign projects to multi-person teams 
because:
<UL>
    <LI> It is important that we learn to play well with others.
    <LI> It requires less laboratory equipment.
    <LI> It reduces the number of assignments that must be graded.
    <LI> It reduces student complaints about how much work is involved.
</UL>
If we understood team projects in this way, we might find ourselves
greatly surprised after graduation, when a completely different set
of goals comes into play.
<P>
This chapter discusses why we assign projects to teams, and how teams
can effectively partition that work among their members.  It is 
hoped that an understanding of these considerations will enable
you to form more teams and accomplish your tasks more effectively.
<P>
<H3>2.1 Why Teams</h3>
<P>
From a managerial perspective, it is often much easier to assign
a task to an individual.  Teams, made up of individuals with
differing goals and experiences, introduce overheads and
problems that seldom come up for individuals.  Why then would
we go to the trouble of creating a team to solve a problem?
<OL type=1>
   <LI> We parallelize efforts because a task would take too 
	long for a single person to complete, 
	<strong>and</strong> 
	we do not know how to break it up into smaller independent tasks.
	<P>
	There are overheads associated with tasking and monitoring
	team activities, and coordinating complementary efforts.
	If we could break the one large tasks into several independent
	tasks, it might well be more efficient to parcel each of
	the smaller sub-tasks out to a different individual.  Smaller
	tasks tend to be performed more efficiently and encounter
	fewer problems.  
	<P>
	Unfortunately, it is often impossible to sub-divide larger 
	tasks into independent sub-tasks.  If there are significant
	interdependencies among the sub-components, it will be 
	necessary to coordinate the efforts of the people who are
	responsible for them.  The overhead of this coordination
	could potentially eliminate the benefits gained by separating
	the sub-tasks.
   <LI>	We create multi-disciplinary teams because some tasks 
	involve more skills than any single person possesses.
	<P>
	Any project is likely to benefit from a synthesis of multiple
	perspectives.
	If a project involves specialized modeling, human factors
	analysis, domain specific knowledge, complex user interfaces, 
	distributed applications and specialized tools it may 
	actually require a significant number of people to 
	assemble the required combination of skills and experience.
	<P>
   <LI> We need multiple people on a task if it involves multiple roles 
	that would be very difficult for a single person to fill.
	<P>
	Prototyping and producing correct code involve different
	skills.  Developing requirements and test cases involve
	different attitudes.  A person who has spent several weeks 
	working on a piece of code is probably convinced of its 
	correctness, and would be a poor choice for a reviewer.
	<P>
	Whether a project involves distinct roles, or it is simply
	a matter of needing another pair of eyes, many tasks will
	be performed much better by multiple people ... even if a
	single person possesses all of the required skills.
   <LI> We also create teams when we think the task is large and 
	complex enough that the robustness/momentum/help benefits of 
	the team will more than compensate for the added costs of 
	communication and coordination.
	<P>
	Individuals can easily become blocked, frustrated, or confused.
	When a group of people is working together on a project, help
	is usually close at hand, and such problems are usually discovered
	and resolved quickly.  A lone individual might spend hours
	(or even months) bumping their head against a wall before 
	someone else noticed and stepped in to help them.
   <LI> We also assign people to work together for reasons that might
	be unrelated to the assigned task.
	<P>
	If a project will involve the use of a new tool or technique,
	we might assign people to the project, for the purpose of
	letting them gain experience with that tool or technique.
	This might be for the purpose of training new people, exposing
	experienced engineers to new technology, or purely to help
	and/or observe in an experiment.  In cases like this, we would
	assign people to the project as much for their own education
	as for the contributions they might make towards the project's
	goals.
</OL>
<P>
Teams are formed for reasons.  If those goals are to be satisfied,
the team must be created with the right people, and organized around
the desired goals.  As is true in most areas, the first step towards
success is clarity about your goals.
<P>
<H3>2.2 Partitioning the work</h3>
<P>
The initial partitioning of work for school projects seems to be based on two
primary goals:
<OL type=a>
   <LI> the likelihood that the work will actually get done.
   <LI> the willingness of the team members to accept the 
	proposed division of labor.
</OL>
Later in the project, if some team members have not accomplished their
appointed tasks, the work gets repartitioned (ignoring consideration b)
among the more capable members, so that the work does get done by the
due date.
<P>
While these constants will always be with us, there are a few additional
considerations that can be incorporated into a more purposeful partitioning
of the work that is more likely to achieve the goals that initially
motivated the formation of the team.
<P>
<h4>2.2.1 Schedule Efficiency</h4>
<P>
In the interests of efficiency, each person should have approximately
the same amount (hours) of work to do.  If person A finishes long before person
B, then shifting work to person A would reduce the time required to
accomplish the task.  This may sound a lot like "fairness", as in giving
each person an equal amount of work ... but equal hours of work 
does not imply equal burdens.  Some people are more productive than others.
Assuming that all team members are putting in the same number of
hours, the shortest time to completion is achieved by giving more
work to the most productive people.
<P>
If all tasks were independent of one-another, it would be a simple
linear programming problem to assign the work to people in a way
that would minimize the total time to completion.  It is, however,
rare for all of a team's tasks to be independent.  If task A 
depends on B and C, and C depends on D and E, it may not make sense
to assign someone to task A until tasks D and E are done.  Reasonable
assignments must consider, not only the total amount of work to be 
done, but the interdependencies among the tasks ... parallelizing
everything possible, and minimizing the time that one person spends
waiting for another.  If a single task is a prerequisite for many 
others, it may make sense to have everyone start out working on that 
one task, to get it finished so that it becomes possible to work 
on all of the other tasks.  Attempting to schedule work without an
understanding of the interdependencies between tasks is a formula
for disaster.  Where the dependency networks are complex, graphical
representations (e.g. PERT charts) and automated
project management tools may become indispensible.
<P>
For some tasks (like research) that involve many independent
activities, it is possible to add extra people and complete the 
task sooner.  For other tasks, assigning extra people can 
reduce efficiency and, potentially, even increase the time
required to do the job:
<UL>
   <LI>	If a task requires two people and you assign four to it,
	the extra two people will find they have little to do,
	and poor use will have been made of their time.
   <LI>	If we take a task that is really appropriate for one
	person, and (unnaturally) break it into two pieces,
	we may find that we actually lose time when coordination
	overhead results in wasted effort and reduced productivity.
</UL>
<P>
<h4>2.2.2 Skill Efficiency</h4>
<P>
Tasks will, in most cases, be done both more quickly and more correctly
by a person who is most skilled at the activities in question.  In many
cases work assignments will indeed be dictated by skills.  
If, however, there are also educational goals to be satisfied, we may
consciously decide to make assignments that do not correspond to
peoples' strengths:
<UL>
   <LI>	we may assign less experienced people to a task, rather
	than other people who are better able to accomplish it,
	so that they can learn the associated tools and techniques.
   <LI> we may assign additional (less experienced) people to a
	task that does not need them, so that they can learn the
	associated tools and techniques.
   <LI> we may assign a person to a task B, rather than for task A
	(for which they are better equipped)
	because task A is well covered, and the schedule requires
	more resources on task B.
</UL>
<P>
<h4>2.2.3 Support</h4>
<P>
Many tasks require cooperation between multiple individuals ... either
for synergy (e.g. Pair Programming) or in complementary roles (e.g.
coding and test case development).  In these cases multiple people will
be assigned to a single task (or set of closely related tasks).  In
these cases, it is important that people clearly understand their 
respective goals, roles and responsibilities.
The issue here is not that there is any right or wrong way to structure
such collaborations, because (for the most part) there isn't.
Rather it is a matter of ensuring that all parties understand the
plan in which they will be cooperating.
<P>
In some cases, all of the people who support a particular effort
will be dedicated to the sub-group that is responsible for that effort.
In other cases, there may be "matrixed" resources, not assigned to
a particular group, but available to help any group that needs them.
Such shared resources can easily become bottlenecks, when multiple
sub-groups need their help at the same time.  These conflicts can
be greatly reduced if the support resources can be scheduled for
specific tasks, or can promise each sub-group a fraction of their
time (e.g. 10 hours per week).
<P>
<h4>2.2.4 Group Activities</h4>
<P>
There are a few activities that are better performed by a whole
team rather than being assigned to a few individuals:
<UL>
   <LI> review of work plans
   	<P>
	Most work plans involve work to be done by all of the
	members of the team, and their review of those plans
	is critical to ensuring that every has "bought in" to
	his portion of the plan.  Even when the plans do not
	involve assignments for all members of the team, it
	is good for all members of the team to understand what
	the overall plan is, so that they can better understand
	their role in it.
   	<P>
   <LI> brain-storming
   	<P>
	Brain-storming is the process of coming up with ideas,
	and is equally valuable for initial product concepts,
	and solutions to troublesome problems.
	Brain-storming sessions benefit from a wide range
	of input, and it is important that all members of 
	a team have the opportunity to provide that input.
   	<P>
   <LI> review of major work products
   	<P>
	When the team is about to publish a major work product,
	it is a good idea to review it with the team.  Since 
	this represents the output of the entire time, the whole
	team should have the opportunity to review and improve
	it.  This also gives everyone the opportunity to better
	appreciate what they have had a hand in creating.
   	<P>
</UL>
<P>

<H4>2.2.5 When it isn't about getting the work done</H4>
<P>
Sometimes projects are undertaken, not because we need the results,
but to develop skills.  This does not end with graduation.  We will 
all be developing new skills throughout our careers.  
If the goal of an exercise is to develop a particular
skill, it is important that everyone who needs the development
do the work (whether independently or colaboratively).
<P>
Similarly, some people participate in project activities because
they need to understand the component that is being built.  This
learning may justify including people on a project who do not 
speed it up ... or even people who actually slow it down.

<H2>3. Meetings</h2>
<P>
If you are working on a team project, it is tautological that you will 
be having team meetings.  These are supposed to be the places where the
most important decisions are made and issues are addressed ... but then
can be painful wastes of time.  A "meeting" is not merely a time and place
where team members get together.

A good meeting is one where:
<UL>
    <LI> there are clearly agreed upon goals.
    <LI> there is an agenda for moving through them.
    <LI> the goals are achieved, and the decisions are recorded.
    <LI> the meeting ends and everybody gets back to work.
</UL>
A bad meeting is one where:
<UL>
    <LI> time is wasted waiting for other people to show up.
    <LI> time is wasted discussing subjects that don't further our goals.
    <LI> time is wasted bringing people up to speed who couldn't find 
    	 the time to study the required background before the meeting.
    <LI> time is wasted on rat-hole issues (that won't be resolved here).
         or 1-1 discussions (that don't require a group meeting).
    <LI> crucial issues are left unresolved, and without a plan for
    	 resolution.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>3.1 Minutes</h3>
<P>
It is often said that if there are no minutes from a meeting "It never happened."
It is frightening how differently different people can remember even the
simplest of discussions.  It doesn't greatly matter if different people 
have different memories about who said what ... but it is crucial that 
key decisions, assignments, and commitments be captured in writing.  
For this reason, every meeting should have a scribe who captures this information.
A basic meeting record should include:
<UL>
    <LI> when and where the meeting took place
    <LI> the purpose of the meeting
    <LI> who was present
    <LI> what issues were resolved, and how
    <LI> what assignments resulted, with what owners and due dates
</UL>
Ideally, this record should be mailed out to all attendees within a
few hours of the meeting.  This serves a few purposes:
<OL type=1>
    <LI> it gives other attendees the opportunity to promptly
         correct errors and omissions in the record.
    <LI> it gives all attendees a record for their future reference.
    <LI> it becomes a permanent record of the decisions and commitments
         that were made.
    <LI> a collection of these minutes very effectively documents
         the evolution of the project, and when and how key decisions
	 were made.
</OL>

<H3>3.2 Leadership</h3>
<P>
More often than not, a good meeting is the result of effective leadership.
I am not, here, referring to such intangibles as charisma or vision, but 
to much simpler skills (or habits):
<UL>
    <LI> put together a list of issues to be addressed (e.g. by gathering
         input from all of the team members).
    <LI> craft an agenda for the addressing of those issues (perhaps delegating
         the planning of particular activities to other participants).
    <LI> for discussions that will require preparation (e.g. reading up
         on an issue) send out a list of materials to be read and guidance
	 on what people should come prepared to discuss.
    <LI> make sure everybody knows when and where to show up and what to bring.
    <LI> guide the discussion through the agenda, making sure that all 
         viewpoints are heard, and that all decisions are clear and recorded.
    <LI> recognize rat-holes and other inappropriate discussions and 
         arrange for them to be dealt with in other forums.
    <LI> do all of the above without overly pissing-off the other team members.
</UL>
Note that most of these come naturally to compulsive type-A personalities.  
The last, however, requires a gentler touch ... and its importance cannot
be over-estimated.  Choose your team leaders carefully ... to ensure that
all of the required skills are well-covered.
<P>
<H2>4. Project Scheduling</h2>
<P>
If the work to be done is a simple matter of sitting down for a few hours to
work on it, a schedule is nothing more than a time the team agrees to meet
and do the work.  If you aren't sure how long it will take (because you
haven't done this sort of thing before), you should block out an overflow
session.  How much contingency time you need to block out depends on how
well (or poorly) you understand the task.  This is probably about as much
scheduling as most of you have (thus far) been forced to do.  Larger 
projects tend to have much more complex scheduling requirements:
<UL>
   <LI> the work involved is not a few hours, but tens, hundreds, or
	thousands of hours.  We can't just "set a side 40 hours" during
	which we will knock-out the project.
   <LI> the work will be accomplished, not in a single "do it all"
	sitting, but rather as tens, hundreds, or thousands of 
	discrete sub-tasks.  Until we have enumerated and described
	all of those sub-tasks, we don't have a clue how much work
	we have to do.
   <LI> many of the sub-tasks will be worked on independently, but some
	tasks require (as inputs) things that are the output of other
	tasks.  Unless we have mapped the dependencies, and scheduled
	the entire network of tasks, we are likely to find that when
	it is time to work on task X, that we are unable to do so
	because it needs the output of tasks A, B, and C, which
	are not yet done.
   <LI> it is not possible to completely define all of the sub-tasks
	until after some preliminary tasks (e.g. research, prototyping,
	design, reviews) have been accomplished.  Unless we carefully
	schedule those investigations up-front, and allow adequate time
	to refine the schedule and accomplish the work that comes out
	of those investigations (how ever much that may be), we will
	find that we have run out of time before we have even figured
	out what we had to do.
</UL>
Embarking on a large project without a clear plan typically results in
spending about 70-80% of the time "just working on the next task", as
it gradually becomes obvious that it will be completely impossible
to complete the project by the required completion date.  Unless you
have a clear plan for success, you very likely have a plan for failure.
<P>
Exactly how much schedule you need depends on how complex the project is.
There are no simple rules to tell you how much project planning you have
to do ... but it is pretty easy to tell whether or not your schedule is
adequate to the project: Go through the review and validation process
described (below) in section 4.4.
<P>
<h3>4.1 Task Breakdowns</h3>
<P>
To schedule a large project, it is necessary to break it down into smaller
pieces (individual tasks and sub-tasks).  For each task, you should describe:
<UL>
   <LI> the prerequisite inputs, and any constraints they must satisfy.
   <LI> the activities to be performed, along with any suggestions or
	constraints on how they should be performed.
   <LI> the outputs to be produced, the forms they should have, and any
  	constraints they must satisfy.
</UL>
<P>
Just how small should a task be?
This is a hard question to answer in the abstract:
<OL type=a>
   <LI> Projects can exist in hierarchical relationships, and task
	size is relative to the work under discussion.
	Consider a large project (e.g. putting a man on the moon).
	One line item in this project plan
	might turn into ten distinct programs, each given to a different
	sub-contractor, and each of those would turn into a dozen projects,
	each of which might expand into hundreds of tasks for a ten person
	group.
   <LI> How clearly a task must be specified depends on the skill and 
	experience of the team to which it is given.  What an experienced 
	engineer would consider to be a very simple task, might have to be 
	presented to a less experienced engineer as a dozen inter-related 
	sub-tasks with a few check-points along the way.
   <LI> The granularity of tasks should be related to the units in which
	work is scheduled and progress is measured.  In a student project,
	it might make sense to define tasks that are only a few hours long.
	Within a development group, it might make sense to define tasks that
	take a one-digit number of days.  Outside of the development group,
	milestones might represent several staff-months of work.  In a major
	project (e.g. a moon launch) a single milestone might represent several
	staff-centuries of work.
</ol>

For our purposes in this class, some reasonable guidelines might be:
<UL>
   
   <LI> It can be a single-person or multi-person activity, 
	but it should be a single, homogenous, activity that 
	it does not make sense to further sub-divide.
   <LI> It should be sufficiently clearly defined, that everyone
 	understands exactly what it means, what it produces, and
	when it is done.
   <LI> It should be sufficiently well understood that it is possible
	to provide reasonable estimates for how long it will take.
   <LI> It should be sufficiently compartmentalized that, given
	the required inputs, it requires no further interaction
	with other tasks until it is complete.
   <LI> It should represent no more than a one-digit number of hours
	of work (to permit reasonable progress tracking in projects
	that will probably take a two-digit number of hours to complete).
</UL>
<P>
Another question about work breakdowns is how specifically the
task needs to be defined.  The answer is, "sufficiently specific
to avoid problems resulting from likely misunderstandings".
There are two different types of specificity here:
<OL Type=a>
   <LI> clear definitions of the work to be done, the required outputs,
	and the requirements the completed work must satisfy.
	<P>
	Producers of work products must clearly understand what is 
	required of them, and consumers must know what to expect. 
	Ambiguity in these requirements usually results in waste,
	whether performing unnecessary work, or fixing inadequate work.
   <LI> explanations of how to perform the work (e.g. by breaking it
	down into smaller steps).
	<P>
	This type of detail is not required from a project planning
	perspective.  If, however, the assigned people are not
	well familiar with the task, such a sub-breakdown can be
	invaluable in guiding them through the process.
</OL>
<P>
<h3>4.2 Task Estimates</h3>
<P>
One good test of how well defined your sub-tasks are is how easy it is for
you to estimate how long it will take.  If you can give an answer to within
an hour, or even to within 25%, your tasks are probably pretty well defined.
If there are powers of two in your estimate (e.g. 3-6 hours) your understanding
of the task is suspect.  If there are powers of ten in your estimate 
(e.g. 2-20 hours) you clearly do not yet understand the task.  
There are two general approaches to dealing with this problem:
<OL type=a>
   <LI> break the task down further, into smaller, clearer, and better
	understood sub-tasks, which will be easier to estimate.
   <LI> get better educated about the activity and how to perform it:
	<UL>
	   <LI> get information from other people who have experience with this
		type of activity.
	   <LI>	pick one simple sub-task, and do it, and see how much work it is,
		and what problems come up.  Based on that experience, you will
		find it much easier to estimate how long the full task will take.
	</UL>
</ol>
<P>
As you are estimating how long it will take to perform each task, it is also a
good idea to note insights you have in the process:
<UL>
   <LI> approaches that can be used to make the task easier.
   <LI> potential problems, for which we must be alert, and ways of dealing with them.
   <LI> skills that this task requires, and who might be best qualified to do it.
</UL>
<P>
<h3>4.3 Task Start and Completion Dates</h3>
<P>
In most cases, and especially with school projects, people have many
responsibilities, and will not be dedicating full time to any one project.
A project schedule does not usually call out a three hour block of time
for a three hour task.  It is more common to specify a period of a few
days, within which that task must be accomplished, and a delivery date
by which it will be completed.  There is no simple formula for the 
relationship between the estimate and the scheduled work period:
<UL>
   <LI> How experienced and productive is the person to whom this
	task will be assigned?
   <LI> How much confidence is there in the estimate?  If the confidence
	is lower, a longer period of time must be allowed.
   <LI> What fraction of the person's time is expected to be spent on
	this task?
   <LI> What other conflicts (courses, assignments, projects, exams, travel,
	social activities, etc) can be expected during this period?
	The alotted time must be large enough, not only for the one task,
	but for all the rest of the things the person has to get done during
	that period.
   <LI> How dependable is the person to whom the task will be assigned?
	Disciplined people who do work ASAP can be scheduled more tightly.
	People whose work is often late, should be given aggressive due
	dates that allow for considerable slippage before they impact other 
	tasks.
</ul>
<P>
Given a number of days that has been set aside for the accomplishment of
each task, and the interdependencies of the tasks, it becomes possible to
lay out a schedule.  With a one-digit number of tasks, this can reasonably
be done on a white-board or a piece of paper.  With a dozen or two tasks,
it might be easier to lay them out on 3x5 cards.  With larger numbers of
tasks, you will almost surely want to use a project planning tool (e.g.
Microsoft Project or Open Workbench).
<UL>
   <LI> Projects can be planned from the start, forwards.
	<P>
	Schedule the first task to start immediately, and
	then schedule the next task to start as soon as that
	finishes, etc.  This tells us the soonest possible
	completion date.
   <LI> Projects can be planed from the end, backwards.
	<P>
	Schedule the last task to end on the due date, and then
	schedule the previous task to complete just before that
	one starts, etc.  This tells us the latest possible
	starting date.
   <LI> Projects can be spread over the available time period.
	<P>
	Schedule the first task to start immediately, and the last
	task to end slightly before the due date, and spread the 
	remaining tasks evenly throughout the alotted interval.  
	This gives us the most slack (to accomodate slippage) 
	for each task.
	<P>
	If you want to get even more sophisticated, don't distribute
	the extra time evenly, but rather in proportion to perceived
	risk ... giving more slack to the scarier tasks.
</UL>
In any cases, it is necessary to honor the task interdependencies.  If
Task B requires (as input) the output of task A, then Task B cannot start
until after task A completes.
<P>
In some cases a basic schedule, laid out in these ways, will work fine.
In many cases, it seems impossible to accomplish all of the tasks in the
available time.  There are a few options:
<UL>
   <LI> revisit the task descriptions to see if some of the tasks can be
	eliminated or simplified.
   <LI> revisit the estimates, and see if some of them can be reasonably reduced.
   <LI> revisit the allotted time for each task, and see if people can dedicate
        more of their effort to tasks to get them done sooner.
   <LI> revisit the inter-dependencies among tasks, to see if more things can 
	be done in parallel (eliminating waiting time).
   <LI> revisit the work allocation to see if more resources can be brought
	to bear on the problem.
</UL>
<P>
The output of this process is a schedule, a complete list of tasks, where
each has:
<OL type=a>
  <LI> a description of the work to be done
  <LI> a description of the outputs to be created
  <LI> an owner
  <LI> a starting date
  <LI> an ending date
</OL>
<P>
<h3>4.4 Validating a Schedule</h3>
<P>
Putting together a schedule that addresses all of the various needs can
be a daunting task, and there is a very natural sigh of relief when you
finish it.  Unfortunately you aren't done yet.  You have to review and
validate the schedule with the rest of the team:
<UL>
   <LI>	does the schedule include all of the known work?
   <LI> are we confident that we understand what each task is,
	and how it will be performed?
   <LI> are we confident that we understand what the outputs of
	each task are, and in what form they will be delivered?
   <LI> are the inputs for each task scheduled to be available by 
	the time that task is scheduled to start?
   <LI> is there enough time allowed for each task?
   <LI> does the person responsible for each task agree that they
	can accomplish it, by the scheduled completion time?
   <LI> are there likely issues or problems that would invalidate
	this schedule?  If so, what are the contingency plans?
   <LI> is everyone willing to commit to doing whatever it takes
	to make their deliveries?
</UL>
Once everyone agrees on all these points, then you have a schedule.
All that remains is "a simple matter of execution".
<P>

<H2>5. Time Management</h2>
<P>
Once there is a validated and accepted schedule, it is up to the individual
task owners to perform their tasks by the stated completion dates.  How 
individuals juggle their commitments is a much simpler 
<strong>time management</strong> problem.  Most of you probably already
have good time management skills, so the following is presented as a basic
review of key principles.
<P>
Prioritize your activities:
<OL type=1>
   <LI> Things you must complete today.
   <LI> Things it is important to complete soon.
   <LI> Things you must do eventually.
   <LI> Things you would like to do soon.
</OL>
It is a good idea to assign times to the most important things, and force
the others to take what ever time is left over.  In assigning times to tasks,
however, it is important to consider a wide range of factors:
<UL>
   <LI> Natural ordering (some tasks prepare you for others).
   <LI> Availability of help at particular times.
   <LI> Minimizing travel by performing co-located tasks together.
   <LI> What your energy level is likely to be at various times of the day.
   <LI> If there are orderings or alternations that will make your day
  	more enjoyable or rewarding.
</UL>
If, at the end of the day, we find we did not get as much done as we had hoped,
we must figure out why.
<UL>
   <LI> Did we mis-estimate the difficulty or required time?
   <LI> Were there pre-requisite resources or tasks that we failed to recognize?
   <LI> Did we fail to dedicate the time we had planned to?
</UL>
Based on this analysis, we can then reassess our estimates and
priorities, and face the next day with a (hopefully) more realistic plan.
<P>
We tend to put off tasks that are unpleasant, complex, or uninteresting.
We can overcome these obstacles by:
<UL>
   <LI> breaking them into smaller sub-tasks
   <LI> doing them first to get them over with
   <LI> blocking out a specific time for them
</UL>
Many people also find that making public commitments to complete a particular
task by a particular time helps them overcome the natural urge to procrastination.
The higher level schedule (discussed in the previous section) represent such a 
commitment.
<P>
<h2>6. Problem Management</h2>
<P>
A schedule is a plan for the future, but you will often hear it said
that "a schedule is a living document" (i.e. it changes over time).  
Robert Burns (in a greatly underrated 19th century treatise on project 
management) put it more poetically:
<UL>
The best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang oft a-gley.<br>
An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain for promised joy.<br>
</UL>
If the problem is a "worthy adversary" we can count on a few surprises:
unforeseen difficulties, conflicting priorities, lower than expected 
productivity, etc.  Most of the problems that arise will not be serious,
and can be easily dealt with
<strong>if they are quickly noticed and effectively responded to</strong>.


<H3>6.1 Tracking Progress</h3>
<P>
We must observe when each task is completed and compare these completion
dates with the schedule.  Any slippage is a warning that something is wrong.
If the problem is recognized and dealt with before it results in further
slippage, the consequences are usually negligible.  If, however, a late
task is allowed to become later, and starts delaying subsequent tasks, 
the situation may quickly devolve into one where the delivery date is no
longer achievable.
<P>
More effective management often follows from finer grained monitoring.
If a single task is expected to take multiple days, there may be value in
checking the progress at multiple points along the way.  If we wait three
days until we find out that the task is going to be late, we may find that
we have lost six days (the three we have already lost, and the three it
will take to make up the missed work).  If, however, we discover after
the first day that no progress has been made, we can institute recovery
measures sooner, with much less time lost.
<P>
Another key principle in project management is "no surprises".  It is common
for someone who is falling behind to try to keep this fact a secret (in the
belief that they will be able to make-up the missing work tomorrow, and
to avoid embarrassment).  It usually turns out, however, that the factors that
prevented progress today will still be there tomorrow ... and that the
embarrassment of letting it be known that you need help is negligible in
comparison with the consequences of causing the whole project to be laten.
<P>
Regular and candid status reporting inevitably leads to a smoother running
project.
<P>
<h3>6.2 Dealing with Problems</h3>
<P>
When a problem delays the completion of a task, we need to do at least two
things to correct the situation:
<OL type=1>
   <LI> Figure out how to get the delayed task accomplished.
	How to do this depends on what has caused the delay:
	<UL>
	   <LI> If an unexpected problem arises, the group may 
		need to brain-storm to come up with a solution.
	   <LI> If the task is larger than expected, or involves skills
		that the assigned person lacks, it may be necessary
	 	to get additional people to help with it.
	   <LI>	If the assigned person doesn't have enough time, 
		it will be necessary to reassess their priorities, 
		or perhaps to reassign the task.  
	</UL>
   <LI> Figure out how to adjust the schedule to accommodate the new realities:
	<UL>
	   <LI> If there was slack in the schedule (e.g. tasks are scheduled
		to be completed before their outputs are actually needed),
		it may be possible to solve the problem before it significantly
		impacts other tasks.
	   <LI> If other estimates were padded (e.g. given more time than they
		were actually expected to take), it may be possible to squeeze
		their schedules and still make the final deadline.
	   <LI> If the plan was to deliver a better product than required,
		it may be possible to re-plan, eliminating some of the optional
		aspects, and still get all of the required work completed
		on time.
	   <LI> It may be possible for everyone to work more hours each day
		until the lost work has been made up.
	   <LI> You can try asking for more time ... but you will find that
		manager's aren't much more understanding than professors in
		granting extensions.  It may happen every once in a while,
		but don't count on it.
	</UL>
</OL>
<P>
A tight schedule, with no room for slippage is brittle in the face of problems.
This is the problem with delaying tasks until the last minute.  A schedule that
starts tasks as soon as possible (and is likely to finish early) is more robust,
and allows time to deal with problems and still make an on-time delivery.

<H2>7. Group Dynamics</h2>
<P>
When you lock a bunch of people in a room together, and put them under
stress, some of them are bound to rub others of them the wrong way.
If I knew how to prevent this, I'd be in Stockholm, thanking the Nobel
committee.  I can, however, suggest a few considerations that may help:
<UL>
    <LI> <strong>not everybody will see it your way</strong><br>
    <P>
    	One of the curses of being smart is clearly seeing answers
	that are not obvious to others.  One of the curses of having
	smart people on your team is that they won't follow a path
	until they believe in it.  This means that you are going
	to have to sell your ideas to the other members of your
	team.  If they don't agree with you:
	<UL>
	    <LI> perhaps they do not appreciate the advantages
	    	 of your approach.  Lay them out clearly.  It
		 is not enough to have a great idea, if you 
		 cannot explain what makes it great.
  	    <LI> perhaps they are responding to other problems
	    	 than you are, and those problems motivate a
		 different approach.  Understand those problems,
		 and help to make sure that they are adequately
		 addressed.
	    <LI> perhaps there are multiple equally good approaches,
	         in which case getting everyone moving on the same plan
		 is much more important than which plan they adopt.
	</UL>
    <P>
    <LI> <strong>everybody has to be heard</strong><br>
    <P>
	People have very different interaction styles:
	<UL>
	    <LI> some people (like me) can be depended on to pontificate
	    	 about what other subject is at hand.
	    <LI> some people (like my daughter) will sit quietly and
	         listen, and will not say anything unless something
		 important has been missed.
	    <LI> some people (who often seem not to like me) may be 
	         overwhelmed by the loud people
	         and won't offer input without an invitation.
	</UL>
	But the volumes of opinions are not always proportional to their
	value, and silence seldom betokens consent.
	<P>
	There is no problem with allowing the people who have the most
	opinions to express them ... because they will probably bring
	out a lot of good issues and alternatives.  Before decisions are
	made, however, everyone has to have an opportunity to weigh in
	on them ... both to ensure that the group benefits from their
	insights, and to give them a stake in (and hence commitment to)
	the decisions.  People who are left out of the decision process
	often feel little commitment to the resulting decisions.
    <P>
    <LI> <strong>everybody has to carry their share</strong><br>
    <P>
    	Different people have different skills, and there will always be
	some people for whom some tasks are easier or harder.  In a small
	project (a few people for a few hours) it may be easier to let the
	more capable people do more of the work than to help the less 
	capable people do it (even though that would, ultimately, be to
	everyone's benefit).  On larger projects, however, this doesn't
	work:
	<UL>
	    <LI> The reason the project was assigned to an N person
	    	 team was because it could not reasonably be accomplised
		 by fewer people in the required time.
	    <LI> The personal tensions created between people who are
	         "busting their buns" and people who are "coasting"
		 will tear the team apart.
	    <LI> The coasters, who are never forced to grow and become
	         more capable will find their careers to be very brief.
	</UL>
    <P>
	Carrying your share is not just a matter of how many lines of
	code you write.  It shows up in a myriad of behaviors:
	<UL>
	    <LI>
		Show up at meetings on time, having done your reading.
	    <LI>
		Work hard to make your commitments, and communicate 
		about your progress.
	    <LI>
		Actively participate in the discussions, and volunteer
		for tasks.
	</UL>
    <P>
    	Everyone on the team has to be working ... but that doesn't mean
	that everybody has to be doing the same work.  A large project
	is made up of a great many tasks, each of which requires a 
	different combination of skills.  If everybody is actively
	participating the work will go quicker, the results will be
	better, and the experience will be a much more positive one.
    <P>
    <LI> <strong>you will succeed or fail, as a team</strong><br>
    <P>
    	We are all in the same boat.  It is foolish to think that
	my half of the boat can stay afloat while your half sinks.
	Maybe some courses have given you individual grades for
	team projects ... but in the real world, if the project
	is a failure, the team has failed ... and individual 
	contributions to that failure are just footnotes.
    <P>
    	If a team member is in trouble, the team has to find a way
	to help them.  If there are tensions between team members,
	the team has to find a way to defuse them.  You don't have
	to be friends with all the people on your team ... but you
	do have to work together effectively.   Keep that in mind.
    <P>
    <LI> <strong>gentle humor and good will are essential</strong><br>
    <P>
    	We are going to assign you non-trivial problems under pressing
	schedules.  You will be stressed, and stress seldom brings out
	the best in people.  Make a point of going out of your way to
	be kind and helpful to the other members of your team.  
    <P>
	This may seem like a small superficiality, but when the going
	gets tough it can make a very big difference.
</UL>
<h2>8. Conclusions</h2>
<P>
For at least 2 million years, hominids have formed teams, and planned strategies
for accomplishing critical tasks.
Why?  Because it increases our chances of success.  
A well functioning team of ordinary people can reliably
achieve results that are beyond the capabilities of the
best individuals.  
As projects get larger, a good plan will beat heroic efforts every time.
Organizing a plan and a team to effectively attack a problem is work.
It is worth it!
<P>
It is tempting to think that these activities are primarily the concerns of managers.
Actually they are the concerns of people who are serious about conquering difficult
problems.  It is not coincidental, however, that people who demonstrate these
abilities often find themselves quickly promoted greater responsibilities.
