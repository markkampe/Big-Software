<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
<P>
Initially, Sun's customers were technophiles who wanted the
latest greatest technology as soon as possible.  They tended
to view new Solaris releases as Christmas presents, and took
delight in the new surprises that each box contained.  As Sun's 
products (the Sparc and Solaris) matured, they were increasingly
adopted for use as engineering desktops, database, and web
servers for major enterprises.  These new customers had a
very different view of technical innovation: 
<UL>
	<LI> First, <strong>do no harm</strong>.
	<LI> Second, schedule your releases, and release them on schedule.
</UL>
<P>
In the earlier years, the goal for every Solaris release 
was to fill it with as much new technology as possible.
As Sun (and their customers) evolved, the costs (to their
customers, and ultimately to Sun) of delayed releases and
shipping software before it was ready came to greatly 
exceed the benefits of early introduction.  Sun's customers
were quite vociferous about this, and Sun got the message.
Solaris releases would no longer be defined by content
(e.g. new features).  Rather they would deliver solid software
on a predictable schedule.
<P>
The new strategy for Solaris releases came to be known as the 
<strong>train model</strong>.  Trains are supposed to leave
on schedule, without regard to which or how many passengers
have boarded by that time.  

<H2>2. The Principles</H2>
<P>
Software companies regularly experience significant delays
in releases because it takes longer than expected to get a
new feature working well enough.  The Solaris train model
says that a project cannot integrate into the product until
it is ready to ship.  If a product is integrated, and found
not to be of acceptable quality, it is immediately thrown off
of the release train.  The reward for this strategy is that
it should be possible to create a new, high quality, Solaris
release at almost any time.
<P>
Several objections were raised to this approach:
<UL>
   <LI> This process would result in content-poor releases
	that customers would not buy.
	<P>
	There were thousands of engineers working on Solaris,
	and a typical release included tens of thousands of
	bug fixes and enhancements, hundreds of minor projects,
	and dozens of major projects.  With so much content in
	each release, the marginal value of most projects was
	actually relatively small.
	<P>
    <LI> This process would be catastrophic for major pieces of new
	infrastructure.  Project A might introduce a new authentication
	framework, that 20 other new projects would exploit.  If project
	A was thrown off of the train, the 20 projects that depended on
	it would also be thrown off the train.
	<P>
	This is not an argument for allowing project A to stay in the
	release even if it is bad.  Rather, it is an argument for:
      <OL type=a>
	<LI> Testing infrastructure projects very carefully before
	     integrating them into the system.
	<LI> Noting project dependencies, and carefully assessing
	     the risks these dependencies cause.  If project B depends,
	     on project A, which has not yet integrated, project
	     B is at risk, and needs a back-up plan.
	<LI> Version control and configuration management tools
	     that make it easy to reverse integration operations
	     and recover any prior version of the project.
      </OL>
	<P>
    <LI> It makes no sense to require a product be completely tested
	 before it is integrated, because in many cases a product
	 cannot be thoroughly tested until it is combined with all
	 of the other elements of the system.
	<P>
	Building a complete version of the product (including new
	functionality) is not the same thing as accepting the new
	functionality into the official product build.  The system
	build tools and environment are standardized and build 
	procedures are completely automated.  Anyone (who has 
	the cycles and disk space) can build a complete version 
	of the system, with any pieces they want, at any time 
	they want.  Once they have built that system, they can
	subject it to any testing that can be performed on the
	official build.
	<P>
    <LI> If we are not allowed to integrate our product into the
	 official build until after it is fully tested, we will
	 not get the benefit of having our new stuff tested by
	 all of the people who use the official builds.
	<P>
	 The official Solaris build is not an internal beta vehicle.
	 It is a product that is being readied for shipment.  If you
	 need more testing, you are responsible for developing a
	 program to perform that testing.  If you still need more
	 testing, you aren't ready to integrate.
	<P>
    <LI> Making a project wait months to officially integrate 
	 (while they do the required exhaustive testing) might mean
	 that they have to continuously change their project to
	 accommodate changes made by other projects that are being
	 allowed to integrate before them.
	<P>
      <OL type=a>
	<LI> Such changes should not come as a surprise.  The Solaris
	     Architectural Review process requires projects that 
	     introduce changes that could impact other projects 
	     to coordinate with the affected projects.
	<LI> The version management tools support branch work-spaces,
	     notifications of changes to checked-out modules, and 
	     tools to facilitate in the merging of independent changes
	     to common modules.
	</OL>
</UL>

<H2>3. The Process</H2>
<P>
Solaris releases are scheduled several years in advance, and
each release has a very detailed calendar of scheduled builds
and cut-off-dates.  Projects apply for admission to a release.
Product management teams review the project plans and (based
on value, risk, dependencies, and competing requests) schedule
each project for a specific build (e.g. Solars 2.10, build 27).
<P>
The project does its work and unit testing, conducts test builds
(that integrate their code into the whole system) and does system
testing on the resulting system.  Prior to their scheduled 
integration date, they present the results of their testing 
to the product management team, who reviews the state of the
project, and grants them permission to integrate.
<P>
The project team conducts one final test build, and then puts
their changes back into the common source tree, where it becomes
integrated into the next official product build.
<P>
Given that the project team has been doing test system builds,
and testing the results for some time (often many months), it
is quite rare for significant problems to arise as a result
of integration.  If such problems do arise, the project is
backed out of the release, and the team has to apply for 
another integration slot.
<P>
As the release ship date approaches, only minor changes
associated with fixes to high priority bugs are allowed
to integrate into the final builds.  This is an effort to
ensure the stability of the product, and that it will ship,
on-time, with an acceptable level of quality.  As we approach
release date, the marginal cost of a mistake (even a small one)
becomes much greater.  This risk is mitigated by raising the
bar on how safe and critical a change has to be before it can
be integrated into the final few builds.
<P>

<H2>4. Conclusion</H2>
<P>
The Solaris Train Model is, in many respects, a continuous
integration model ... in that new code can be integrated into
a complete system at any time.  This has tremendous advantages
for testing and finding problems as quickly as possible.
<P>
The primary difference between the Solaris Train Model and more
traditional continuous integration is the distinction between
development builds and the official build.
<UL>
  <LI>	the obvious cost of this separation is the cycles, disk space,
	and human effort required to produce all of the 
	(redundant) development builds.
<P>
	a secondary cost is that delaying the integration of
	changed modules into the official product line, creates
	a wider window in which other projects can introduce
	(potentially) conflicting changes.
<P>
  <LI>	the reward for this separation is that it is extremely 
	rare for a project put-back to adversely affect the
	product build.
</UL>
<P>
In large projects, with large numbers of relatively independent
developers, the costs of such collateral damage can be very high.
In products where quality and stability are more important than
speed, this trade-off can be a good one.
For a company in Sun's position, the added development
overheads were a small price to pay for a significant
improvement in release schedule and quality confidence.
<P>
Your mileage may differ.
