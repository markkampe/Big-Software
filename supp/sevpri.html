<H1>Bug Severity and Priority</H1>
<P>

<P>
In a large project there are likely to be many bugs ... sufficiently 
many that they will not all be fixed promptly.  It becomes necessary
to decide which bugs to fix sooner, and which to fix later.  Long ago
battle-field doctors learned to divide casualties into three groups:
<OL type=1>
   <LI> those who would almost surely die (treatment wouldn't make a difference).</li>
   <LI> those who would almost surely live (treatment can be delayed).</li>
   <LI> those who could be saved if treated promptly.</li>
</OL>
Taking a few minutes to perform this sorting (called <em>triage</em>,
in reference to the <em>three</em> groups) 
greatly improved the effectiveness of battle-field medicine.  A similar
process is followed with bugs ... although hopefully without a class
of problems that will doom the product regardless of any action on
our part :-)
<H2>Which bugs to fix first</h2>
<P>
Bugs are, to a first approximation, dealt with on the basis of their
<em>severity</em> and <em>priority</em>.  Because these two words 
determine which bugs will be fixed, control over the defintion of
these terms translates into control over what work does and does
not get done;
Arguments that might seem to be about definitions
may be power struggles in disguise.
</P>
<P>
There may be no universally accepted definitions for
these terms, but the following should give you a foundation from 
which you can enter into discussions on the subject:
<UL>
   <LI> <strong>severity</strong> 
	is probably the better defined of these two terms, and is 
	usually taken to be a measure the consequences to the victim.
	System failure and loss of important data might be consdered 
	to be very severe, confusing error messages might be considered
	to be of relatively low severity.
	<P>
	There are many (per organization) standards for grading severity, but
	a typical one might be:
	<OL type=1>
	    <LI> permanent data or service loss.</li>
	    <LI> unable to use primary functionality</li>
	    <LI> impared use of primary functionality, or
		 unable to use secondary functionality.</li>
	    <LI> minor inconvenience.</li>
	    <LI> suggestion.</li>
	</OL>
	<P>
	Many organizations adopt the convention that the 
	<string>severity</strong> of a bug is <em>owned by</em>
	the submitter (the submitter gets to determine how
	seriously (s)he was impacted).
   </li>
   <LI> <strong>priority</strong> is a concept with a much wider
	range of meanings.  The most cogent meaning I have found
	is that it is a measure of the importance (to the success of the project)
	of fixing this bug.  The <strong>severity</strong> is
	surely one of the factors in determining this, but there
	may be other equally important factors:
	<UL>
	    <LI> how likely it is that others will encouter the problem</li>
	    <LI> the availability of a work-around</li>
	    <LI> the expectations that have been set for the product in question</li>
	</UL>
	<P>
	In keeping with such a defininition the <strong>priority</strong>
	of a bug is <em>owned by</em> the product owner, and a 
	priority scale might be:
	<OL type=1>
	    <LI> <u>must fix</u> immediately (e.g. within 24 hours).</li>
	    <LI> <u>must fix</u> in next release (product cannot ship without this fix).</li>
	    <LI> <u>should fix</u> in next release (too many of these will stop shipment).</li>
	    <LI> fix when it is convenient (e.g. we are working on this code for other reasons).</li>
	    <LI> may get to it some day.</li>
	</OL>
   </li>
</UL>
<H2>Priority in Agile projects</H2>
<P>
In a large company with large teams and formal process, the above priority definitions
can provide a basis for:
<ul>
   <li>development decisions about what to work on next</li>
   <li>management decisions about whether or not the product is ready to ship</li>
</ul>
In a more <em>agile</em> project, with regular (e.g. weekly)
deliveries, decisions about what work to do next (in
the next sprint) are:
<ul>
    <li>made, case-by-case, by the product owner</li>
    <li>not represented by numeric priorities, but rather by ordering of tasks in the <em>backlog</em>
	(e.g. a
	<A href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-project-board">Project Board</a>
	of 
	<A href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues">Github Issues</a>)
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<P>
There would seem to be a significant philosophical difference between:
<ul>
    <li>a bug prioritization team determining what work must
        be completed before a release can be shipped</li>
    <li>a product owner deciding, week by week,
        what the best use of resources
        (for both bug fixing and new features) for the next
	sprint would be</li>
</ul>
But if we look at the factors the product owner will consider
when ordering tasks in the backlog, they are probably very 
similar to those that a prioritization team would use in 
assigning priorities.
