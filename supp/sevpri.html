In a large project there are likely to be many bugs ... sufficiently 
many that they will not all be fixed promptly.  It becomes necessary
to decide which bugs to fix sooner, and which to fix later.  Long ago
battle-field doctors learned to divide caualties into three groups:
<OL type=1>
   <LI> those who would almost surely die (treatment wouldn't make a difference).
   <LI> those who would almost surely live (treatment can be delayed).
   <LI> those who could be saved if treated promptly.
</OL>
Taking a few minutes to perform this sorting (called <em>triage</em>,
in reference to the <em>three</em> groups) 
greatly improved the effectiveness of battle-field medicine.  A similar
process is followed with bugs ... although hopefully without a class
of problems that will doom the product regardless of any action on
our part.
<P>
Bugs are, to a first approximation, dealt with on the basis of their
<em>severity</em> and <em>priority</em>.  Because these two words 
determine which bugs will be fixed, control over the defintion of
these terms translates into control over what work does and does
not get done.  Arguments that would seem to be about the meanings 
of these terms are often political arguments in disguise.
There are no universally accepted definitions for
these terms, but I will try to give you a foundation from which you can
enter into discussions on the subject.
<P>
<UL>
   <LI> <strong>severity</strong> 
	is probably the better defined of these two terms, and is 
	usually taken to be a measure the consequences to the victim.
	System failure and loss of important data might be consdered 
	to be very severe, confusing error messages might be considered
	to be of relatively low severity.
	<P>
	There may be standards for grading severity, like:
	<OL type=1>
	    <LI> permanent data or service loss.
	    <LI> unable to use primary functionality
	    <LI> impared use of primary functionality, or
		 unable to use secondary functionality.
	    <LI> minor inconvenience.
	    <LI> suggestion.
	</OL>
	<P>
	Many organizations adopt the convention that the 
	<string>severity</strong> of a bug is <em>owned by</em>
	the submitter (the submitter gets to determine how
	seriously she was impacted).
   </li>
   <LI> <strong>priority</strong> is a concept with a much wider
	range of meanings.  The most cogent meaning I have found
	is that it is a measure of the importance (to the project)
	of fixing this bug.  The <strong>severity</strong> is
	surely one of the factors in determining this, but there
	may be other equally important factors:
	<UL>
	    <LI> how likely it is that others will encouter the problem
	    <LI> the availability of a work-around
	    <LI> the expectations that have been set for the product in question
	</UL>
	<P>
	In keeping with such a defininition the <strong>priority</strong>
	of a bug is <em>owned by</em> the product owner, and a 
	priority scale might be:
	<OL type=1>
	    <LI> must fix immediately.
	    <LI> must fix in next release.
	    <LI> should fix in next release.
	    <LI> fix when it is convenient.
	    <LI> may get to it some day.
	</OL>
   </li>
</UL>
