# TEST SUITE:	filesync-reconciliation
# TEST CASE:	cflct-data-atr 
# SUMMARY:	conflicting changes: data vs attributes
# VERSION:	1.2 of 6/18/96
# DESCRIPTION:
#	conflicts where one side had contents changes, and
#	the other side had attribute changes should be correctly
#	detected and automatically reconciled
#

set-up:
	Create six files that will be identical on both sides,
	with known contents, modes, owner, and group
		.../cflct-data-atr-md
		.../cflct-data-atr-od
		.../cflct-data-atr-gd
		.../cflct-data-atr-ms
		.../cflct-data-atr-os
		.../cflct-data-atr-gs

	reconcile and ensure no differences were found and establish baseline

test:
	1. on the source side
		new contents .../cflct-data-atr-md
		new contents .../cflct-data-atr-od
		new contents .../cflct-data-atr-gd
		change modes .../cflct-data-atr-ms
		change owner .../cflct-data-atr-os
		change group .../cflct-data-atr-gs

	2. on the destination side
		new contents .../cflct-data-atr-ms
		new contents .../cflct-data-atr-os
		new contents .../cflct-data-atr-gs
		change modes .../cflct-data-atr-md
		change owner .../cflct-data-atr-od
		change group .../cflct-data-atr-gd

	3. reconcile with verbose output

expectations:
	1. successful reconciliation with warnings (RC=1)

	2. stderr should describe six conflicts
		.../cflct-data-atr-md: contents and protection
		.../cflct-data-atr-od: contents and owner
		.../cflct-data-atr-gd: contents and group
		.../cflct-data-atr-ms: contents and protection
		.../cflct-data-atr-os: contents and owner
		.../cflct-data-atr-gs: contents and group

	3. stdout should describe
		three successful data copies from src to dst
		three successful data copies from dst to src
		three successful attribute changes from src to dst
		three successful attribute changes from dst to src

	4. final audit should show
		all six files with new contents
		cflct-data-atr-m[sd] with new protections
		cflct-data-atr-o[sd] with new owner
		cflct-data-atr-g[sd] with new group

verification:
	compare rc, stderr, stdout and audit with golden output
	report any differences as an error

cleanup:
	none required (uses unique files)
