By the end of this course, the students will have not only studied,
but actually performed, all of the major 
steps of a large software project.  It is hoped that these exercises
will consolidate the learning of these skills and well-prepare students
for larger projects to come.  There is, in some sense, only one project
for the entire course, but it is broken down into a few distinct phases
(involving very different activities):

<H2> Background on Projects</h2>
<P>
It is traditional, in Software Engineering courses, to have students
build a large project.  This is intended to give students the opportunity
to apply many of the skills covered in the reading and lectures.  And
I must concede that building software is the most obvious form for
projects in a Software Engineering class to take.
<P>
In looking at what students have actually done in these projects, I
have found a few major concerns:
<UL>
<LI> 
	Students are expected to develop coding and debugging skills in the 
	lower division programming series.  
	The academic material in a Software Engineering course deals with 
	project models, work products, requirements, 
	analysis, design, (representation, characteristics of good designs, 
	processes for evolving them), review, testing, and an introduction 
	to projects, process, and organization.  
	<P>
	In a typical Software Engineering project, students spend (at best) 
	25% of their time on these activities, and 75% of their time coding 
	and debugging.  This is realistic (in that it mirrors real software
	development) but it doesn't provide much opportunity for the students
	to apply the taught techniques and develop the associated skills.
<LI>
	The success of a small software project probably has more to do with
	the motivation, skill, and experience of the development team than
	with the methodology they employ.  Software Engineering disciplines
	have evolved to manage the risks and complexities of large projects. 
	<P>
	The typical class project involves a one digit number
	of staff-months of work: 
	the size of a single task in many large software projects.
	While these projects are highly educational, and a necessary step in
	the development of discipline and skills, they seem (to me)
	too small to demand significant exercise of "Software Engineering"
	(as opposed to programming) skills.
<LI>
	Projects (whether research or commercial) seldom fail because
	the developers lacked sufficient familiarity with languages
	or other programming tools.  Projects fail because of:
	<UL>
	    <LI> poor requirements
	    <LI> lack of a concrete plan
	    <LI> having a bad plan, and not realizing it
	    <LI> failure to recognize and obtain required resources
	    <LI> failure to recognize and respond to problems
	    <LI> poor time and resource management
	</UL>
	If this course is to make a difference, it must address
	these problems.
</UL>
<P>
My goal, in defining projects for this course, has been to create a series
of projects that will focus primarily on the primary skills taught in the 
course.  
<UL>
   <LI> In teams, students will be asked to develop 
	<strong>requirements</strong> and 
	<strong>architecture</strong>
	something larger more complex than can reasonably be built in a
	one semester course.
	The advantage of this approach is that they will gain the opportunity
	to exercise important skills that would be poorly (if at all)
	exercised by smaller projects.

   <LI> Each team will then identify a single component of the 
	proposed project (that is small enough to be reasonably
	accomplished in a few weeks), develop specifications, 
	a design, and a test plan, and then build and test that
	component according to those plans.
</UL>
<P>
Another goal of these projects is to develop organizational, planning, time
management, and post-mortem review skills.  This is accomplished by not
breaking the second project into small pieces, but rather, requiring the
students to do this.  The students are not merely responsible for
producing the required work products, but plans for their production.
The project grades are based, in part, 
on the quality of the plans, the dilligence that was paid to them, 
and the insights gained in retrospect.  
It is further hoped that the post-mortem reviews will help consolidate 
learning of both process and technical lessons.
<P>
Thus the assigned projects should be seen, both in terms of the primary
technical skills they exercise, and successively more demanding sets of
project management responsibilities.  I assert that it is these skills
(and not additional programming ability) that are the primary focus
of this course.
