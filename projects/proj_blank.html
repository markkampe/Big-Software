<H3>2.8 Post-Mortem Report</H3>
</a>
This project is a learning exercise, and one of the major ways
we learn is by analyzing past mistakes.  You will, as a team,
review all aspects of this project.  One of you will then 
summarize that process into a post-mortem analysis report.
<P>
<H4>2.8.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
A report, summarizing the key issues raised in your post-mortem,
and the conclusions you came to.  Your post-mortem discussion 
should include:
<ul>
	<li> FIX stuff
	<li> FIX stuff
	<li> FIX stuff
	<li> FIX stuff
	<li> FIX stuff
</ul>
<P>
Note that if you make no mistakes, you will not be able to earn any points
on the post-mortem.  Fortunately, no teams have ever found it necessary
to deliberately make mistakes in order to have something to analyze.

<a name="grade_pm">
<H4>2.8.2 Grading</h4>
</a>
This report be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 50% whether or not you meaningfully discuss each of the required activities.
	<li> 20% whether or not you identify all of the important incidents.
	<li> 30% the extent to which you are able to derive and articulate useful lessons
	     (and good future advice) from those experiences.

<H4>2.9 Management</h4>
<a name="desc_mgt"></a>

<a name="grade_mgt">
The team will be graded on how effectively they managed themselves
and the work: 
</a>
<OL type=a>
    <LI> Perform the work according to the plan.<br>
	 We will determine when work was done by looking
	 at the dates of the final check-ins.
    <LI> Monitor progress and detect problems.<br>
	 Monitoring plans should be included in your
	 project plan.  Status should be reviewed regularly,
	 and logged as updates to the project plan.
	 Problems that come up should be recorded as updates 
	 to the project plan and discussed in your post-mortem.
    <LI> Reasonably adjust the plan in response to problems.<br>
	 Detected problems and responses should be discussed
	 in your post-mortem, and reflected in revisions to
	 the plan.

<H2>3. Rules </H2>

<A name=latepolicy>
<H3>3.1 Due Dates and Slip Days</H3>
</a>
<P>
Any assignment that is not turned in by its <strong>due date</strong>,
will have its grade reduced by 10% (of its nominal value) for each
late day.  I understand that problems happen, and so each student is
granted three <em>slip days</em>.  A team of four students would have
twelve slip days between them.
<P>
One slip-day will excuse <strong>one</strong> deliverable 
being late by <strong>one</strong> day.   
If a design is one day late, and that delays the
design review by a day, then you may find that you need two slip-days.  
Don't make the mistake of using up your slip-days too soon, because
the pressures generally get tighter later in the course. 
<P>
When a team needs to use slip-days, they need to decide who's
days they are using.  However you decide is OK with me, but
we will be tracking the slip days per student.
If will be using any slip days on a deliverable, tell me in 
advance that you will be doing so (so that I don't nag you
about whether or not I lost your submission message).

<a name="individual">
<H3>3.2 Team and Individual Grades</H3>
</a>
<P>
When we tackle big projects, we succeed or fail as a team.
Consequently, the majority of the grade you earn on a team 
project will be based on the overall quality of the team's 
product.   But a team can only be successful if everybody
is working towards producing quality results.
Thus, a non-negligible portion of your grade
will be based on individual contributions:

<a name="breakdown"></A>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
	<th>criterion</th> <th>value</th>
</tr>
<tr>	<td>quality of <a href=#primary>primary authorships</a></td>	<td>10%</td> </tr>
<tr>	<td><a href=#share>share of project work</a></td>	<td>5%</td> </tr>
<tr>	<td>personal on-time performance</td>	<td>5%</td> </tr>
</TABLE>

<A name="primary">
<H3>3.3 Primary Authorship</h3>
</A>
While many activities (e.g. Post Mortem review) are fundamentally team
activities, each major work product will typically have a primary author:
one person who works up the basic organization, pulls together the contribution
from the other team members and writes most of the prose.
<P>
The ability to organize large collections of information into a coherent
narrative is an important skill, and each team members should take primary
authorship for multiple work products.  The quality portion of the individual
contribution grade is based on the work products for which that person was
the primary author (presided over a process, or wrote at least 2/3 of
the text in a document).
<P>
Each work product submission must include an indication of the
primary author (or authors if no individual produced 2/3 of the text).
Note, however, that since the whole team will be graded
on the quality of each work product, it is only prudent
for the entire team to review any high-value work product 
before it is submitted.

<A name="share">
<H3>3.4 Share of Project Work</H3>
</A>
The quantification of individual contributions is an inexact process.
Reports of hours-spent are sometimes unreliable, and often seem 
poorly correlated to results obtained.  None the less, team members
generally have a pretty good sense of who is working how hard and
contributing how much value.
At the end of each project, each member of each team should submit
(by private e-mail to me) an assessment of how the overall effort
was divided between the various project activities and team members.
Something like:
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
	<tr> <th>activity</th> 		<th>fraction of total</th>	<th>Algernon</th> <th>Balder</th> <th>Osiris</th> </tr>
        <tr> <th>management</th>	<td>15%</td>	<td>50%</td>	<td>30%</td>	<td>20%</td>	</tr>
        <tr> <th>research</th>		<td>25%</td>	<td>00%</td>	<td>75%</td>	<td>25%</td>	</tr>
        <tr> <th>report 1</th>		<td>10%</td>	<td>10%</td>	<td>75%</td>	<td>15%</td>	</tr>
        <tr> <th>prototyping</th>	<td>35%</td>	<td>20%</td>	<td>15%</td>	<td>65%</td>	</tr>
        <tr> <th>final report</th>	<td>15%</td>	<td>50%</td>	<td>25%</td>	<td>25%</td>	</tr>
</TABLE>
<P>
I will keep these as confidential, and average them together to get a sense
of the individual contributions to each team's efforts.
<P>
<h3>3.5 Collaboration and Citation</a></h3>
<p>
This is a team project, but different individuals will have primary
responsibility for different processes or work products (or different 
parts of a single work product or process).  Each team will be working 
on a different type of product.  You are free to talk your team members 
(and for that matter other teams) about the processes you are following.
You may review your work products with your own team members, and revise
them based on their feedback ... but ...
</a></p><ol type="1">
<a name="5_rules">   </a><li><a name="5_rules">	If you are the primary author of a work-product, you must
	cite the source of text you did not write (if it is more
	than a sentence), or any information that did not originate
	within your team or from your interviews.
	</a><p>
<a name="5_rules">	You will be doing research to develop your product definition and
	requirements.  I expect that many of the ideas for your product
	will come from this research.  Cite all of your sources for each
	work product, and explain how each source contributed to your work
	products.
</a></p></li><li><a name="5_rules"> You may not share any of your work products (other than as required
     for reviews) with members of other teams.
