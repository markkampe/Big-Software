It is intended that, for most rubric items,  you be able to simply assign:
	X		unsatisfactory
	check-minus	weak
	check		satisfactory
	check-plus	well done

    If you give a check-minus or X to anything, explain why in the comment
    lines beneath that rubric item.


Assign points (based on the marks) in each section:

	if all marks check or better, the section earns full points

	check-minus marks are probably worth half-points, but check-plus marks 
	compensate for check-minus marks
	
	an X for any item in the section probably means zero points for that section


Absent something exceptional, the overall assignment score should simply be the 
sum of the points in the individual sections.
