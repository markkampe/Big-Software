<H2>1. Introduction</h2>
</a>

What is the difference between a <em>concept</em> and a <em>proposal</em>?  
<UL>
	<li> A <em>concept</em> is something that can be discussed.
	<li> A <em>proposal</em> is something that can be acted on.
</UL>
Before a grant is given or a new project is funded, a clear
proposal has to be developed for the work to be done, why
it is worth doing, and why the proposed effort is likely to
be successful.  There are many steps on the path from 
<em>concept</em> to <em>proposal</em>.
<ul>
    <li> developing an understanding of the problem to be solved
    <li> developing a description of the work to be done
    <li> verifying the feasibility and likely value of the proposed work
    <li> developing a plan for the investigation to be performed
</ul>
<P>
The primary goal of this project is to give you real experience with the
development of a concept, the gathering, organizing and prioritizing of 
requirements, and the development of a proposal for a software product.
A secondary goal is to develop your abilities to intelligently 
plan a group endeavor, effectively manage it, and critically evaluate 
the completed effort.  
<P>

<p>
<A name="desc">
<H2>2. Major Activities and Deliverables</h2>
</a>

You are to form into small (idealy 4-5 person) teams and come up
with a concept for a new or improved software product.  
You will then spend the next month developing that concept into
a proposal.
<P>
There are several major parts to this project, each of which has its
own goals, processes, and deliverables:
<ol type=1>
	<li><b>Initial concept and plan </b><br> 
		You will develop a preliminary concept, and a plan for
		turning it into a proposal.
	<li><b>Competitive Analysis</b><br> 
		You will research existing products in this area, 
		position your proposal against this field, and develop 
		a competitive value proposition.
	<li><b>Preliminary requirements development</b><br>
		You will identify potential users for your product,
		and explore their needs and the characteristics a
		product would require in orer to satisfy those needs.
	<li><b>Concept Presentation</b><br>
		You will develop a brief presentation to introduce
		people to the type of product you are exploring.
	<li><b>Requirements Elicitation </b><br>
		You will present your concept to potential users,
		gather input from them on their needs, and their
		reactions to your proposal.
	<li><b>Requirements Analysis</b><br>
		You will synthesize the feedback from the requirements
		elicitation in to a clear set of prioritized and validated
		prodoct requirements.
	<li><b>Final proposal</b> <br>  
		You will combine all of the above into a final proposal 
		(what will be built, why it will be successful) to be
		submitted to get funding for further investigation.
	<li><b>Post Mortem</b> <br>
		You will review the processes you followed in this project,
		to see what lessons you can learn for how to do things more
		effectively in the future.
	<li><b>Project Management </b><br> 
		All of the above will be planned, documented, and managed.
</ol>
<a name="desc_1">
<H3>2.1 Concept and Plan</h3>
</a>

Every project begins with:
<UL>
  <LI> a concept for something to do
  <LI> a plan for exploring the concept
</UL>

<H4>2.1.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
A concept document is a very brief description of what you propose to
do and a justification for why it is worth doing.
<P>
The living document that lays out the plan (du-jour), its progress, and its
evolution over the course of the project is the Management Plan.  
<p> 
<H5>2.1.1.1 Concept</H5>
<P>
Write up a brief (e.g. 1/2 page) description of your idea, including justifications
for why you believe it to be:
<UL>
   <LI> valuable as a product
   <LI> something that could actually be built and used
   <LI> something that you will be capable of designing
   <LI> fun for you to work on
</UL>
<H5>2.1.1.2 Management Plan</h5>
<p> 
Most of the individual sub-tasks associated with this project can be done 
in a couple of hours by one or two people.  But there are a great many of these
tasks to be performed, and (you will discover) not a great deal of time in which
to get them done.  The only way you will succeed is if you have a plan (who is
going to do what, when, and then who will do what with it) for the entire project.
<P>
Each team will prepare a task-breakdown, identify the dependency relationships between
tasks, and owners for each sub-task, assign due-dates, and schedule regular reviews
of both work-products and progress (to enable adequate time to deal with the
problems that <strong>will</strong> happen).  
<UL>
	A good plan will ensure that all work is done before the
	due date, but allow people a reasonable amount of slack
	in when they have to do each particular task.  
	A plan to defer everything to the last minute is likely
	to fail when last-minute problems are discovered.
	An aggressive plan that people won't be able to 
	achieve guarantees a fire-drill in a few weeks
	when it finally becomes clear that it cannot be followed.
<p>
	Experience has shown that vague plans are easier to create
	up-front, but create problems down-stream (when people
	turn out to have been unclear about exactly what they were
	supposed to do, by when, and in what form they were to 
	deliver their output).  Similarly if you do not specifically
	map out the dependency relationships among the tasks, you
	may find that your schedule is unrealistic, because it 
	does not allow sufficient time for sequential tasks.
</UL>
<P>
The key to ensuring problems are detected before it is too late
is regular communication, and continuous comparison of actual progress vs the
plan.  A good management plan will include regular status
checks, the results of which should be recorded in the plan document.
As your understanding of the problem
evolves and you respond to unanticipated events, you will have to revise your plan.
If deadlines are missed, or deliverables fail to pass review, the fact, as well
as the causes and the plan to remedy them must be documented.
<P>
You can prepare and submit this plan in any form you like, but the sort
of information I had in mind was:

<a name="desc_2">
<H3>2.2 Competitive Research</h3>
</a>
Do research to identify existing products in your space
(or the closest existing products to a new space),
their capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses.
Identify <strong>multiple</strong> ways in which you could 
significantly improve on these products.  
(if you cannot significantly improve on existing products, 
then there is no need for a new one).
<P>

<H4>2.2.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
Write up a brief description of the existing products, along with
notes on their key strengths and weaknesses.
Note the (positive or negative) lessons you can learn from each
of these products.
Write up a list of feasible and valuable improvements that you
could reasonably make in a new product, and briefly justify 
their value and practicality.
<P>
Note that this is a list of ideas, and will be graded on 
organization, quality of analysis, and clarity of insight.
It will not be graded as prose.

<a name="grade_2">

<a name="desc_3">
<H3>2.3 Preliminary Requirmenents</h3>
</a>
Brainstorm on your product concept and the capabilities of
existing products to get ideas for what your product should
do.  Identify different types of users who might have different
needs, and then identify capabilities, characteristics,
and/or use cases for each.  
<P>
The specific form in which you choose to represent these
requirements is up to you.  Basic capabilities may be best
captured by simple declarative sentences.  Complex or role
based interactions may be best captured by use cases.  Use
the forms that you think best capture the requirements in
question.
<P>
As you gather new requirements from customers, clarify
them, validate them, reconcile conflicts, and prioritize
them, I recommend that you make these changes in successive
versions of a single requirements document.  
This will clearly show us the work you did in evolving and 
refining your requirements, 
and ensure that you receive full points for these activities.
<P>
Again, there is no need for this document to be any more
than organized notes.

<H4>2.3.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
Document
<ul>
    <li> the various types of people who might want to use your product.
    <li> the goals that each user would have.
    <li> the needs, abilities, and expectations different types of users would bring.

<H3>2.4 Concept Presentation</h3>
</a>
Before asking potential users for requirements suggestions, we have to give
them some idea of what we are talking about.  This should be a brief (five
minutes or less) presentation on the type of product being considered.
<strong>This is not a sales pitch!</strong>  
As we will discuss in our <strong>requirements</strong>
lecture, it is crucial that we not contaminate the panel with our own thoughts.  The purpose
of a requirements elicitation is for us to get information from the customers.
As such, the presentation should be limited to establishing a context for the questions to follow.
<P>
<H4>2.4.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
A brief (3-6 minutes) prepared presentation (including slides and/or other visual aids)
introducing the product concept as  background for the requirements elicitation.

	     understand the form, purpose, and use of the intended product).
	<li> 10% the extent to which it does not otherwise contaminate or prejudice the
	     clients.
	<li> 10% how effectively it stimulates interest in the product, making them
	     eager to provide input.

<P>
You may prepare and deliver this presentation in any 
form you choose, but the written submission should be 
in some relatively universal format (e.g. pdf, power-point,
HTML, Googledoc) and submitted via URL (so that it is
easily viewable by others).

<H3>2.5 Requirements Elicitation </h3>
</a>

As described in the Requirements lecture, there are many possible sources
of product requirements.  One of the most important sources is the intended
users.  The better we understand what they do, and how the proposed product
would be used, the better we can design a product to meet their needs.  
Each team will be asked to design and conduct a session in which they will
gather requirements information from potential users.

<H4>2.5.1 Deliverables</h4>

This is a ~30 minute face-to-face meeting with potential users where
you will gather information to develope and validate requirements. 
<OL>
    <li>
	Briefly (in less than 60 seconds) introduce yourselves and the agenda
    <li>
	Give your concept presentation
    <li>
	Start with open-ended information gathering about the educational goals in
	question, how they pursue them, what problems they encounter, the gaming
	activities of students, their computer use, etc.
    <li>
	Then move into more specific questions, following up on interesting points
	raised in the open-ended questions, and posing the more directly product-focused 
	questions that you have come up with.
    <li>
	Get their comments on information you have gained from other sources.
	Note: It is possible that, in the process of giving you
	their own requirements, the customers will actually
	touch on all of your own previously gathered requirents.
	If this is the case, when you get to that part of the
	agenda, specifically affirm that they have reiterated
	(or how they have changed) that prior input.
    <li>
	Present a summary of the key messages you have gotten from them today, 
	and give them the opportunity to correct/amend those.
    <li>
	Thank them for their participation.
</ol>

<b> Team roles: </b>
<ul>
    <li> Moderator:  Leads the meeting, discussions, etc.
    <li> Scribe: Takes notes
    <li> Others: <br>
	All team members will play important parts in making this a success.
	The moderator and scribe will typically be too busy to actually
	think about and process what is being said in real time.
	Other team members should
	<ul>
	    <li>
		Distill long discussions into punch-lines for the summary.
	    <li> 
		Keep track of points that need further clarification before we are done.
	    <li> 
		Check off comments that relate to previously suggested requirements, 
		and maintain a list of requirements that still require validation.
	    <li> Watch the agenda and the clock,
		 and help the moderator keep to the agenda and 
		 make sure that nothing is missed (because it is very
		 difficult to think while talking).
	</ul>
</ul>

<a name="grade_5">
<H4>2.5.2 Grading</h4>
</a>
This process will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 35% the extent to which you are able to adhere to the process (which will be described,
	     in the reading, given to you in writing, and demonstrated in class).
	<li> 50% the extent to which you are able to obtain useful information from the clients
	     about their needs and perceptions in this area.
	<li> 15% the extent to which you are able to validate and clarify prior
	     assumptions and questions about requirements.
</ul>
<a name="sub_5">
<H4>2.5.3 Submission</h4>
</a>

When you have identified a panel of potential users, schedule an appointment
with me for your requirements elicitation session.  I can be available for a
few hours after class on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and I can arrange to come back
to campus on weekends or after 8PM on other week days.


<a name="desc_6">
<H3>2.6 Requirements Report and Analysis</H3>
</a>
The characteristics of good requirements are discussed in both
the reading and the lecture on requirements.  Starting with
your initial (brain-stormed) requirements:
<OL type=1>
   <LI> revise them based on customer feedback (and your
	evolving understanding of the problem)
   <LI>	add the new requirements gathered from customers.
   <LI> look for ambiguous requirements, and clarify them.
   <LI> assign a value to each requirement, and justify
	that assignment.
   <LI> assign a confidence to each requirement (that
	you have properly understood it and/or its
	value).
   <LI> look for conflicting requirements, and resolve the
	conflicts.
   <LI> assign a difficulty (easy, moderate, hard) to each,
	and justify your assignment.
   <LI> assign a priority to each requirement, and then
	ladder them priority.
   <LI> suggest a cut-off line for release 1.0, and justify
	why that is the right place to draw the line.
</OL>
<P>
When you sit down to come up with a final set of requirements, 
it is likely that you will discover that some of the input
you got in your elicitation was not as clear as it seemed at
the time.  When this happens, you have two options:
<UL>
   <LI>	Go back to the person from whom you got the requirement
	and seek clarification.
   <LI> If it is non-critical, document the uncertainty and
	take your best guess.
</UL>

<H4>2.6.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
You will submit two reports:
<OL type=1>
   <LI>	organized notes from the requirements elicitation session.
   <LI> a requirements analysis based on the information gained from that session.
</OL>

<P>
<H5>2.6.1.1 Report from Elicitation Session</h5>
After the elicitation session, scribe should write up the 
minutes and up-load it to github.  
<P>
From the detailed minutes (which should be under version control) the you 
will discuss the results and prepare a summary report that synthesizes the 
information gathered.  The report should include:
<ol>
    <li> When and where the session took place and who attended.

<H5>2.6.1.2 Requirements Analysis</h5>
<P>
Based on the results of your requirements analysis, prepare a priority 
ordered list of product requirements.  For each, list:
<ul>
	<li> the stated requirement
	<li> its priority, and your justification for that determination
	<li> its difficulty, and your basis for that assessment
	<li> your confidence in that requirement, and where it came from
</ul>
<P>

<a name="grade_6">
<H4>2.6.2 Grading</h4>

The written report of the elicitation session will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 10% form (capturing who, when where, topic)
	<li> 10% completeness (all key points captured)
	<li> 10% understanding what the customer said (correctly, and deeply)
	<li> 10% the analysis of this information and distillation of requirements
	<li> 10% the clarity, organization and readability of the report
</ul>
The requirements analysis will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 10% completeness of the lists
	<li> 10% clarity of the requirement statements
	<li> 10% reasonablness/appropriateness of the requirements
	<li> 10% prioritizaty and traceability

<a name="sub_6">
<H4>2.6.3 Submission</h4>
</a>
Maintain both your minutes and the report on github.
It would be prudent for the
entire team to review the requirements analysis before it is submitted.
When you are ready to submit them for grading, fill
out the following form and e-mail it to the submission alias.

<H3>2.7 Final Proposal</H3>
</a>
This is a written proposal to management for why they should fund this investigation: 
<UL>
    <LI> It should include an overview of the concept.
    <LI> It should describe the key users and the needs to which your proposal responds.
    <LI> It should include competitive positioning information.
    <LI> It should include validation (from your customer interviews) of
         that your proposal responds to a real need and would be a compelling product.
    <LI> It should include a list of key requirements the product must satisfy.
    <LI> It should include some basis for believing this project to be feasible.
</UL>

<B>HINT</B>
<UL>
	The director to whom you are submitting this proposal can be
	viewed as another type of user, with her own sets of needs.
	Your product need not respond to your director's needs ... 
	but your proposal (if it is to be successful) must do so!
	This means you need some idea of who your director is and
	what problems she is trying to solve.
</UL>

<H4>2.7.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
A written project proposal for the funding of a new product investigation.
<P>
This proposal will be graded much more on content than on format, so ASCII
text on github is completely acceptable.  If you want to submit it in a
richer format (e.g. so you can include images), PDF, PowerPoint, Googledocs,
or HTML are also acceptable.
<P>
Note that executives (even R&D directors) are notorious for very short 
attention spans ... so short and crisp is much better than long and
elaborate.

<a name="grade_7">
<H4>2.7.2 Grading</h4>
</a>
<P>
This proposal will be graded on the basis of:
<UL>
   <LI> 20% clarity and cogency of the concept
   <LI> 20% clarity and the target user descriptions
   <LI> 20% clarity and persuasiveness of the value proposition
   <LI> 10% clarity, depth, authoritativeness, cogency of the competitive analysis
   <LI> 10% clarity, prioritization, provenance of the key requirements
   <LI> 10% likelihood that I would fund this investigation
   <LI> 10% likelihood that I would hire the team that prepared this report
</UL>

Maintain your plan and concept description on github.
You will probably be updating both of these, and we 
will be reviewing their history.

<H3>2.8 Post-Mortem Report</H3>
</a>
This project is a learning exercise, and one of the major ways
we learn is by analyzing past mistakes.  You will, as a team,
review all aspects of this project.  One of you will then 
summarize that process into a post-mortem analysis report.
<P>
<H4>2.8.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
A report, summarizing the key issues raised in your post-mortem,
and the conclusions you came to.  Your post-mortem discussion 
should include:
<ul>
	<li> the concept definition, research, and brainstorming activities
	<li> the customer requirements elicitation planning, execution, and results analysis
	<li> the organization and creation of the final proposal
	<li> the planning and ongoing management of these activities
	<li> the overall project as an educational exercise.
</ul>
<P>
Note that if you make no mistakes, you will not be able to earn any points
on the post-mortem.  Fortunately, no teams have ever found it necessary
to deliberately make mistakes in order to have something to analyze.

<a name="grade_pm">
<H4>2.8.2 Grading</h4>
</a>
This report be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 50% whether or not you meaningfully discuss each of the required activities.
	<li> 20% whether or not you identify all of the important incidents.
	<li> 30% the extent to which you are able to derive and articulate useful lessons
	     (and good future advice) from those experiences.
</ul>

<H2>3. Rules </H2>

<A name=latepolicy>
<H3>3.1 Due Dates and Slip Days</H3>
</a>
<P>
Any assignment that is not turned in by its <strong>due date</strong>,
will have its grade reduced by 10% (of its nominal value) for each
late day.  I understand that problems happen, and so each student is
granted three <em>slip days</em>.  A team of four students would have
twelve slip days between them.
<P>
One slip-day will excuse <strong>one</strong> deliverable 
being late by <strong>one</strong> day.   
If a design is one day late, and that delays the
design review by a day, then you may find that you need two slip-days.  
Don't make the mistake of using up your slip-days too soon, because
the pressures generally get tighter later in the course. 
<P>
When a team needs to use slip-days, they need to decide who's
days they are using.  However you decide is OK with me, but
we will be tracking the slip days per student.
If will be using any slip days on a deliverable, tell me in 
advance that you will be doing so (so that I don't nag you
about whether or not I lost your submission message).

<a name="individual">
<H3>3.2 Team and Individual Grades</H3>
</a>
<P>
When we tackle big projects, we succeed or fail as a team.
Consequently, the majority of the grade you earn on a team 
project will be based on the overall quality of the team's 
product.   But a team can only be successful if everybody
is working towards producing quality results.
Thus, a non-negligible portion of your grade
will be based on individual contributions:

<a name="breakdown"></A>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
	<th>criterion</th> <th>value</th>
</tr>
<tr>	<td>quality of <a href=#primary>primary authorships</a></td>	<td>10%</td> </tr>
<tr>	<td><a href=#share>share of project work</a></td>	<td>5%</td> </tr>
<tr>	<td>personal on-time performance</td>	<td>5%</td> </tr>
</TABLE>

<A name="primary">
<H3>3.3 Primary Authorship</h3>
</A>
While many activities (e.g. Post Mortem review) are fundamentally team
activities, each major work product will typically have a primary author:
one person who works up the basic organization, pulls together the contribution
from the other team members and writes most of the prose.
<P>
The ability to organize large collections of information into a coherent
narrative is an important skill, and each team members should take primary
authorship for multiple work products.  The quality portion of the individual
contribution grade is based on the work products for which that person was
the primary author (presided over a process, or wrote at least 2/3 of
the text in a document).
<P>
Each work product submission must include an indication of the
primary author (or authors if no individual produced 2/3 of the text).
Note, however, that since the whole team will be graded
on the quality of each work product, it is only prudent
for the entire team to review any high-value work product 
before it is submitted.

<A name="share">
<H3>3.4 Share of Project Work</H3>
</A>
The quantification of individual contributions is an inexact process.
Reports of hours-spent are sometimes unreliable, and often seem 
poorly correlated to results obtained.  None the less, team members
generally have a pretty good sense of who is working how hard and
contributing how much value.
At the end of each project, each member of each team should submit
(by private e-mail to me) an assessment of how the overall effort
was divided between the various project activities and team members.
Something like:
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
	<tr> <th>activity</th> 		<th>fraction of total</th>	<th>Algernon</th> <th>Balder</th> <th>Osiris</th> </tr>
        <tr> <th>management</th>	<td>15%</td>	<td>50%</td>	<td>30%</td>	<td>20%</td>	</tr>
        <tr> <th>research</th>		<td>25%</td>	<td>00%</td>	<td>75%</td>	<td>25%</td>	</tr>
        <tr> <th>report 1</th>		<td>10%</td>	<td>10%</td>	<td>75%</td>	<td>15%</td>	</tr>
        <tr> <th>prototyping</th>	<td>35%</td>	<td>20%</td>	<td>15%</td>	<td>65%</td>	</tr>
        <tr> <th>final report</th>	<td>15%</td>	<td>50%</td>	<td>25%</td>	<td>25%</td>	</tr>
</TABLE>
<P>
I will keep these as confidential, and average them together to get a sense
of the individual contributions to each team's efforts.
<P>
<h3>3.5 Collaboration and Citation</a></h3>
<p>
This is a team project, but different individuals will have primary
responsibility for different processes or work products (or different 
parts of a single work product or process).  Each team will be working 
on a different type of product.  You are free to talk your team members 
(and for that matter other teams) about the processes you are following.
You may review your work products with your own team members, and revise
them based on their feedback ... but ...
