<h1>Project Phase 1<br>
</a>
Concept Development, Requirements and Proposal</h1>
</center>

<P>
<H2>Introduction</h2>
What is the difference between a <em>concept</em> and a <em>proposal</em>?  
<UL>
	<li> A <em>concept</em> is something that can be discussed.</li>
	<li> A <em>proposal</em> is something that can be acted on.</li>
</UL>
Before a grant is given or a new project is funded, a clear
proposal has to be developed for the work to be done, why
it is worth doing, and why the proposed effort is likely to
be successful.  There are many steps on the path from 
<em>concept</em> to <em>proposal</em>.
<ul>
    <li> developing an understanding of the problem to be solved</li>
    <li> developing a description of the work to be done</li>
    <li> verifying the feasibility and likely value of the proposed work</li>
    <li> developing a plan for the investigation to be performed</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
The primary goal of this project is to give you real experience with the
development of a concept, the gathering, organizing and prioritizing of 
requirements, and the development of a proposal for a software product.
A secondary goal is to develop your abilities to intelligently 
plan a group endeavor, effectively manage it, and critically evaluate 
the completed effort.  
</P>
<P>
You are to form into small (idealy 4-5 person) teams and come up
with a concept for a new or improved software product.  
You will spend the next month developing that concept into
a proposal.
</P>

<P>
There are multiple phases to this project, each of which has its
own goals, processes, and deliverables:

<a name="desc_1a"> <H3>P1A - Concept and Plan</h3> </a>

Every project begins with:
<UL>
  <LI> a concept for something to do</li>
  <LI> a plan for exploring the concept</li>
</UL>
<P>
A concept document is a very brief description of what you propose to
do and a justification for why it is worth doing.
</P>
<P>
The living document that lays out the plan (du-jour), its progress, and its
evolution over the course of the project is the Management Plan.  
</p> 
<a name="desc_1a1"><H4>P1A.1 Concept</H4></a>
<P>
Write up a brief (e.g. 1/2 page) description of your idea, including justifications
for why you believe it to be:
<UL>
   <LI> valuable as a product</li>
   <LI> something that could actually be built and used</li>
   <LI> something that you will be capable of designing</li>
   <LI> fun for you to work on</li>
</UL>
Your initial concept will be graded on the basis of:
<UL>
   <LI> 40% clarity - I understand what you propose to do.</li>
   <LI> 20% value proposition - I understand why I (or someone else) would find it valuable.</li>
   <LI> 20% practicality as a product - I believe it could be successfully built.</li>
   <LI> 20% practicality for this project - I believe you can specify and design it.</li>
</UL>
</P>
<a name="desc_1a2"><H4>P1A.2 Management Plan</h4></a>
<p> 
Most of the individual sub-tasks associated with this project can be done 
in a couple of hours by one or two people.  But there are a great many of these
tasks to be performed, and (you will discover) not a great deal of time in which
to get them done.  The only way you will succeed is if you have a plan (who is
going to do what, when, and then who will do what with it) for the entire project.
<P>
Each team will prepare a task-breakdown, identify the dependency relationships between
tasks, and owners for each sub-task, assign due-dates, and schedule regular reviews
of both work-products and progress (to enable adequate time to deal with the
problems that <strong>will</strong> happen).  
<UL>
	A good plan will ensure that all work is done before the
	due date, but allow people a reasonable amount of slack
	in when they have to do each particular task.  
	A plan to defer everything to the last minute is likely
	to fail when last-minute problems are discovered.
	An aggressive plan that people won't be able to 
	achieve guarantees a fire-drill in a few weeks
	when it finally becomes clear that it cannot be followed.
<p>
	Experience has shown that vague plans are easier to create
	up-front, but create problems down-stream (when people
	turn out to have been unclear about exactly what they were
	supposed to do, by when, and in what form they were to 
	deliver their output).  Similarly if you do not specifically
	map out the dependency relationships among the tasks, you
	may find that your schedule is unrealistic, because it 
	does not allow sufficient time for sequential tasks.
</UL>
<P>
The key to ensuring problems are detected before it is too late
is regular communication, and continuous comparison of actual progress vs the
plan.  A good management plan will include regular status
checks, the results of which should be recorded in the plan document.
As your understanding of the problem
evolves and you respond to unanticipated events, you will have to revise your plan.
If deadlines are missed, or deliverables fail to pass review, the fact, as well
as the causes and the plan to remedy them must be documented.
<P>
You can prepare and submit this plan in any form you like, but the sort
of information I had in mind was:

   MEETINGS AND PROGRESS MONITORING:

        We will have a face-to-face meeting every Tuesday after class to review 
        our plan for the week.

        We will have a 5 minute IRC chat each day at 8PM for a quick status check.
        Other working meetings will be scheduled as needed.

        If something goes wrong, send-email to the rest of the team THAT DAY.
</pre>
<P>
Your initial Management Plan will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 40% good use of time and resources (work apportioned reasonably over the available time)
	<li> 20% specificity of plan (clear responsibilities: who, what, when)
	<li> 20% provisions for early detection of problems, and time to deal with them
	<li> 20% completeness
</ul>
</P>

<P>
Maintain your plan and concept description on github.
You will probably be updating both of these, and we 
will be reviewing their history.

<a name="desc_1b">
<H3>P1B - Competitive Research and Positioning</h3>
</a>
Do research to identify existing products in your space
(or the closest existing products to a new space),
their capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses.
Identify <strong>multiple</strong> ways in which you could 
significantly improve on these products.  
(if you cannot significantly improve on existing products, 
then there is no need for a new one).
</P>
<P>
Write up a brief description of the existing products, along with
notes on their key strengths and weaknesses.
Note the (positive or negative) lessons you can learn from each
of these products.
Write up a list of feasible and valuable improvements that you
could reasonably make in a new product, and briefly justify 
their value and practicality.
</p>
<P>
Note that this is a list of ideas, and will be graded on 
organization, quality of analysis, and clarity of insight.
It will not be graded as prose.
</p>
<p>
Your research and analysis will be graded on the basis of:
<UL>
    <LI> 40% how well you identified competing, similar
	 or related products.</li>
    <LI> 40% the clarity and credibility which you understood and
	 characterized their capabilities.</li>
    <LI> 20% the practicality and value of your proposed improvements</li>

<H3>P1C - Requirmenents Development</h3>
</a>
<P>
Clarity is power.
Our success in building a new piece of software is a function of
how clearly we understand its intended functionality.  
Its success in satisfying its users is a function of how well
we understand their needs.
Requirements Development is the process of developing those
understandings. 
</P>
<P>
In this phase of the project you will:
<ul>
    <li> develop your own proposed list of product requirements. </li>
    <li> identify and characterize the types of users for which your product is intended. </li>
    <li> conduct <em>requirements elicitation</em> interviews with ptential users.</li>
    <li> analyze the results of those interviews and develop a set of formal project requirements.</li>
</ul>

<a name="desc_1c1">
<H4>P1C.1 - Preliimnary Requirements</H4>
</A>
<P>
Brainstorm on your product concept and discuss the capabilities of
existing products to get ideas for what your product should
do.  Identify different types of users who might have different
needs, and then identify capabilities, characteristics,
and/or use cases for each.  
</P>
<P>
The specific form in which you choose to represent these
requirements is up to you.  Basic capabilities may be best
captured by simple declarative sentences.  Complex or role
based interactions may be best captured by use cases.  Use
the forms that you think best capture the requirements in
question.
</P>
<P>
As you gather new requirements from likely users, clarify
them, validate them, reconcile conflicts, and prioritize
them, I recommend that you make these changes in successive
versions of a single requirements document.  
This will clearly show us the work you did in evolving and 
refining your requirements, 
and ensure that you receive full points for these activities.
</P>
<P>
Again, there is no need for this document to be any more
than organized notes.
</P>
<P>
Describe
<ul>
    <li> the various types of people who might want to use your product.</li>
    <li> the goals that each user would have.</li>
    <li> the needs, abilities, and expectations different types of users would bring.</li>
    <li> the types of users to which you feel best able to respond</li>
    <li> the requirements your product would need to meet to satisfy those customers</li>
</ul>

<P>
These requirements will be graded on the basis of:
<UL>
    <LI> 20% how well you understood who your users might be</li>
    <LI> 40% how well you anticipated their likely needs</li>
    <LI> 40% how well you were able to capture these needs in requirements</li>
</UL>

<a name="desc_1c2">
<H4>P1C.2 Concept Presentation</h4>
</a>
Before asking potential users for requirements suggestions, we have to give
them some idea of what we are talking about.  This should be a brief (five
minutes or less) presentation on the type of product being considered.
<strong>This is not a sales pitch!</strong>  
As we will discuss in our lecture on requirements,
it is crucial that we not contaminate the panel with our own thoughts.  The purpose
of a requirements elicitation is for us to get information from the customers.
As such, the presentation should be limited to establishing a context for the questions to follow.
</P>
<P>
A brief (3-6 minutes) prepared presentation (including slides and/or other visual aids)
introducing the product concept as  background for the requirements elicitation.
</P>
<P>
This presentation will be graded on:
<ul>
	<li> 20% logical/information presentation structure.</li>
	<li> 40% its effectiveness in establishing context (the interviewees 
	     understand the form, purpose, and use of the intended product).</li>
	<li> 10% the extent to which it does not otherwise contaminate or prejudice the
	     clients.</li>
	<li> 10% how effectively it stimulates interest in the product, making them
	     eager to provide input.</li>
	<li> 10% how good an impression it makes (polished and professional).</li>
	<li> 10% its length: 3-6 minutes</li>
</ul>

<P>
This presentation will be given at the
start of your requirements elicitation session, but
any prepared materials (e.g. slides) must be prepared
and made available for review prior to the actual elicitation.
</P>
<P>
You may prepare and deliver this presentation in any 
form you choose, but the written submission should be 
in some relatively universal format (e.g. pdf, power-point,
HTML, Googledoc) and submitted via URL (so that it is
easily viewable by others).

<a name="desc_1c3">
<H3>P1C.3 - Requirements Elicitation </h3>
</a>
<P>
As described in the Requirements lecture, there are many possible sources
of product requirements.  One of the most important sources is the intended
users.  The better we understand what they do, and how the proposed product
would be used, the better we can design a product to meet their needs.  
Each team will be asked to design and conduct a session in which they will
gather requirements information from potential users.
</P>
<P>
This is a ~30 minute face-to-face meeting with potential users where
you will gather information to develope and validate requirements. 
<OL>
    <li>
	Briefly (in less than 60 seconds) introduce yourselves and the agenda</li>
    <li>
	Give your concept presentation</li>
    <li>
	Start with open-ended information gathering about the educational goals in
	question, how they pursue them, what problems they encounter, the gaming
	activities of students, their computer use, etc.</li>
    <li>
	Then move into more specific questions, following up on interesting points
	raised in the open-ended questions, and posing the more directly product-focused 
	questions that you have come up with.</li>
    <li>
	Get their comments on information you have gained from other sources.
	Note: It is possible that, in the process of giving you
	their own requirements, the customers will actually
	touch on all of your own previously gathered requirents.
	If this is the case, when you get to that part of the
	agenda, specifically affirm that they have reiterated
	(or how they have changed) that prior input.</li>
    <li>
	Present a summary of the key messages you have gotten from them today, 
	and give them the opportunity to correct/amend those.</li>
    <li>
	Thank them for their participation.</li>
</ol>

<b> Team roles: </b>
<ul>
    <li> Moderator:  Leads the meeting, discussions, etc.</li>
    <li> Scribe: Takes notes</li>
    <li> Others: <br>
	All team members will play important parts in making this a success.
	The moderator and scribe will typically be too busy to actually
	think about and process what is being said in real time.
	Other team members should
	<ul>
	    <li>
		Distill long discussions into punch-lines for the summary.</li>
	    <li> 
		Keep track of points that need further clarification before we are done.</li>
	    <li> 
		Check off comments that relate to previously suggested requirements, 
		and maintain a list of requirements that still require validation.</li>
	    <li> Watch the agenda and the clock,
		 and help the moderator keep to the agenda and 
		 make sure that nothing is missed (because it is very
		 difficult to think while talking).</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<P>
This process will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 35% the extent to which you are able to adhere to the process (which will be described,
	     in the reading, given to you in writing, and demonstrated in class).
	<li> 50% the extent to which you are able to obtain useful information from the clients
	     about their needs and perceptions in this area.
	<li> 15% the extent to which you are able to validate and clarify prior
	     assumptions and questions about requirements.
</ul>
</P>
<P>
When you have identified a panel of potential users, schedule an appointment
with me for your requirements elicitation session.  I can be available for a
few hours after class on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and I can arrange to come back
to campus on weekends or after 8PM on other week days.

<a name="desc_1c4">
<H3>P1C.4 - Requirements Report and Analysis</H3>
</a>
<P>
The characteristics of good requirements are discussed in both
the reading and the lecture on requirements.  Starting with
your initial (brain-stormed) requirements:
<OL type=1>
   <LI> revise them based on customer feedback (and your
	evolving understanding of the problem)</li>
   <LI>	add the new requirements gathered from customers.</li>
   <LI> look for ambiguous requirements, and clarify them.</li>
   <LI> assign a value to each requirement, and justify
	that assignment.</li>
   <LI> assign a confidence to each requirement (that
	you have properly understood it and/or its
	value).</li>
   <LI> look for conflicting requirements, and resolve the
	conflicts.</li>
   <LI> assign a difficulty (easy, moderate, hard) to each,
	and justify your assignment.</li>
   <LI> assign a priority to each requirement, and then
	ladder them priority.</li>
   <LI> suggest a cut-off line for release 1.0, and justify
	why that is the right place to draw the line.</li>
</OL>
</P>
<P>
When you sit down to come up with a final set of requirements, 
it is likely that you will discover that some of the input
you got in your elicitation was not as clear as it seemed at
the time.  When this happens, you have two options:
<UL>
   <LI>	Go back to the person from whom you got the requirement
	and seek clarification.</li>
   <LI> If it is non-critical, document the uncertainty and
	take your best guess.</li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
You will submit two reports:
<OL type=1>
   <LI>	organized notes from the requirements elicitation session.</P>
   <LI> a requirements analysis based on the information gained from that session.</P>
</OL>

<P>
After the elicitation session, scribe should write up the 
minutes and up-load it to github.  
</P>
<P>
From the detailed minutes (which should be under version control) the you 
will discuss the results and prepare a summary report that synthesizes the 
information gathered.  The report should include:
<ul>
    <li> When and where the session took place and who attended.</li>
    <li> Interesting information gained during the open-ended
	information gathering.</li>
    <li> Clear statements of significant new requirements that 
	were suggested, along with an assessment of how important 
	each is and why.</li>
    <li> Significant input on previously gathered requirements,
	affirming, refuting, or changing them.</li>
    <li>Any other useful results gained from the meeting.</li>
</ul>
<P>
Based on the results of your requirements analysis, prepare a priority 
ordered list of product requirements.  For each, list:
<ul>
	<li> the stated requirement</li>
	<li> its priority, and your justification for that determination</li>
	<li> its difficulty, and your basis for that assessment</li>
	<li> your confidence in that requirement, and where it came from</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
The written report of the elicitation session will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 10% form (capturing who, when where, topic)</li>
	<li> 10% completeness (all key points captured)</li>
	<li> 10% understanding what the customer said (correctly, and deeply)</li>
	<li> 10% the analysis of this information and distillation of requirements</li>
	<li> 10% the clarity, organization and readability of the report</li>
</ul>
The requirements analysis will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 10% completeness of the lists</li>
	<li> 10% clarity of the requirement statements</li>
	<li> 10% reasonablness/appropriateness of the requirements</li>
	<li> 10% prioritizaty and traceability</li>
	<li> 10% clarity, organizatin and readability of the report</li>
</ul>

Maintain both your minutes and the report on github.
It would be prudent for the
entire team to review the requirements analysis before it is submitted.

<H3>P1D.1 - Final Proposal and Post Mortem</H3>
</a>
<P>
Having thought about what you want to build, describing it to others,
and getting their feedback, you should now be prepared to:
<OL type="a">
    <LI> write up a proper proposal for your project.</li>
    <LI> assess how this process went, and what you have learned from it.</li>
</ol>
</P>
<a name="desc_1d1">
<H4>P1D.1 - Final Proposal</H4>
The key deliverable is a written proposal to management about why they should fund this investigation: 
</a>
<UL>
    <LI> It should include an overview of the concept.</li>
    <LI> It should describe the key users and the needs to which your proposal responds.</li>
    <LI> It should include competitive positioning information.</li>
    <LI> It should include validation (from your customer interviews) of
         that your proposal responds to a real need and would be a compelling product.</li>
    <LI> It should include a list of key requirements the product must satisfy.</li>
    <LI> It should include some basis for believing this project to be feasible.</li>
</UL>

<B>Hints (about the real world):</B>
<UL>
	The <em>director</em> to whom you are submitting this proposal can be
	viewed as another type of user, with her own sets of needs.
	Your product need not respond to your director's needs ... 
	but your proposal (if it is to be successful) must do so!
	This means you need some idea of who your director is, what
	constraints she is under, and what problems she is trying to solve.
	<P>
	Note that executives (even R&D directors) are very busy, and
	often suffer from short attention spans ... so brief and to-the-point 
	is generally better than long and elaborate.
</UL>

<P>
This proposal will be graded much more on content than on format, so ASCII
text on github is completely acceptable.  If you want to submit it in a
richer format (e.g. so you can include images), PDF, PowerPoint, Googledocs,
or HTML are also acceptable.
</P>
<P>
This proposal will be graded on the basis of:
<UL>
   <LI> 20% clarity and cogency of the concept</LI>
   <LI> 20% clarity and depth of the target user descriptions</LI>
   <LI> 20% clarity and persuasiveness of the value proposition</LI>
   <LI> 10% clarity, depth, authoritativeness, cogency of the competitive analysis</LI>
   <LI> 10% clarity, prioritization, provenance of the key requirements</LI>
   <LI> 10% likelihood that I would fund this effort</LI>
   <LI> 10% likelihood that I would hire the people who prepared this report</LI>

<H4>P1D.2 - Post-Mortem Analysis</H4>
</a>
This project is a learning exercise, and one of the major ways
we learn is by analyzing past mistakes.  You will, as a team,
review all aspects of this project.  One of you will then 
summarize that process into a post-mortem analysis report.
</P>
<P>
A report, summarizing the key issues raised in your post-mortem,
and the conclusions you came to.  Your post-mortem discussion 
should include:
<ul>
	<li> the concept definition, research, and brainstorming activities</li>
	<li> the customer requirements elicitation planning, execution, and results analysis</li>
	<li> the organization and creation of the final proposal</li>
	<li> the planning and ongoing management of these activities</li>
	<li> the overall project as an educational exercise.</li>
</ul>
<P>
Note that if you make no mistakes, you will not be able to earn any points
on the post-mortem.  Fortunately, no teams have ever found it necessary
to deliberately make mistakes in order to have something to analyze.
</P>
<P>
This report be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 50% whether or not you meaningfully discuss each of the required activities.</li>
	<li> 20% whether or not you identify all of the important incidents.</li>
	<li> 30% the extent to which you are able to derive and articulate useful lessons
	     (and good future advice) from those experiences.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
Make sure that you have kept your management plan up-to-date,
upload the notes from your post-mortem discussion to github,
and when you are ready to submit them for grading, fill out a
<a href="#submission">standard submission form</a>
and e-mail it to the submission alias.
