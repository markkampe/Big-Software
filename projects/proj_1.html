<h1>Project Phase 1<br>
</a>
Concept Development, Requirements and Proposal</h1>
</center>

<P>
<H2>Introduction</h2>
</P>
<P>
What is the difference between a <em>concept</em> and a <em>proposal</em>?  
<UL>
	<li> A <em>concept</em> is something that can be discussed.</li>
	<li> A <em>proposal</em> is something that can be acted on.</li>
</UL>
Before a grant is given or a new project is funded, a clear
proposal has to be developed for the work to be done, why
it is worth doing, and why the proposed effort is likely to
be successful.  There are many steps on the path from 
<em>concept</em> to <em>proposal</em>.
<ul>
    <li> developing an understanding of the problem to be solved</li>
    <li> developing a description of the work to be done</li>
    <li> verifying the feasibility and likely value of the proposed work</li>
    <li> developing a plan for the (above) investigation to be performed</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
The primary goal of this project is to give you real experience with the
development of a concept, the gathering, organizing and prioritizing of 
requirements, and the development of a proposal for a software product.
A secondary goal is to develop your abilities to intelligently 
plan a group endeavor, effectively manage it, and critically evaluate 
the completed effort.  
</P>
<P>
You are to form into small (idealy 4 person) teams and come up
with a concept for a new or improved software product.  
You will spend the next month developing that concept into
a proposal.
</P>

<P>
There are multiple phases to this project, each of which has its
own goals, processes, and deliverables:

<a name="desc_1a"> <H3>P1A - Concept and Plan</h3> </a>

Every project begins with:
<UL>
  <LI> a concept for something to do</li>
  <LI> a plan for exploring the concept</li>
</UL>
<P>
A concept document is a very brief description of what you propose to
do and a justification for why it is worth doing.
</P>
<P>
The living document that lays out the plan (du-jour), its progress, and its
evolution over the course of the project is the Management Plan.  
</p> 
<a name="desc_1a1"><H4>P1A.1 Concept</H4></a>
<P>
Write up a brief (e.g. no more than one page) description of your idea, including justifications
for why you believe it to be:
<UL>
   <LI> valuable as a product</li>
   <LI> something that could actually be built and used</li>
   <LI> something that you would (given sufficient time) be capable of designing and building</li>
   <LI> fun for you to work on</li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
In order to exercise a full range of software engineering skills
(e.g. competitive analysis, requirements, research and prototyping,
architecture, etc), the project you propose must be a fairly large one.
Most acceptable proposals are too large to be implemented by four people 
in one semester.  Fortunately you will only be required to implement
a few pieces of the whole product.
</P>
<P>
Your initial concept will be graded on the basis of:
<UL>
   <LI> 40% clarity - I understand what you propose to do.</li>
   <LI> 20% value proposition - I understand why I (or someone else) would find it valuable.</li>
   <LI> 20% practicality as a product - I believe it could be successfully built.</li>
   <LI> 20% practicality for this project - I believe you can specify, design and build it (given sufficient time).</li>
</UL>
</P>
<a name="desc_1a2"><H4>P1A.2 Management Plan</h4></a>
<p> 
Most of the individual sub-tasks associated with this project can be done 
in a couple of hours by one or two people.  But there are a great many of these
tasks to be performed, and (you will discover) not a great deal of time in which
to get them done.  The only way you will succeed is if you have a plan (who is
going to do what, when, and then who will do what with it) for the entire project
(from initial concept through final proposal and Post Mortem report).
<P>
Each team will prepare a task-breakdown, identify the dependency relationships between
tasks, and owners for each sub-task, assign due-dates, and schedule regular reviews
of both work-products and progress (to enable adequate time to deal with the
problems that <strong>will</strong> happen).  
<UL>
	A good plan will ensure that all work is done before the
	due date, but allow people a reasonable amount of slack
	in when they have to do each particular task.  
	A plan to defer everything to the last minute is likely
	to fail when last-minute problems are discovered.
	An aggressive plan that people won't be able to 
	achieve guarantees a fire-drill in a few weeks
	when it finally becomes clear that it cannot be followed.
	<p>
	Experience has shown that vague plans are easier to create
	up-front, but create problems down-stream (when people
	turn out to have been unclear about exactly what they were
	supposed to do, by when, and in what form they were to 
	deliver their output).  Similarly if you do not specifically
	map out the dependency relationships among the tasks, you
	may find that your schedule is unrealistic, because it 
	does not allow sufficient time for sequential tasks.
	<p>
	More complex deliverables (like the concept presentation and
	final proposal) should be broken into sub-tasks.  The most
	obvious sub-task is to prepare and review a table of contents
	before actually writing the content.  
	If any deliverable appears to be non-trivial, discuss it in
	a team meeting and identify (more straight forward) sub-tasks 
	that it can be broken into.
</UL>
<P>
The keys to ensuring problems are detected (while there is still time to fix them)
are regular communication, and continuous comparison 
(of actual progress vs the plan).  
A good management plan will include regular (e.g. daily) status checks:
<ul>
    <li> status updates, new realizations, and other discussion topics should 
    	 be recorded in a file (e.g. <tt>minutes.txt</tt>) in your repo.</li>
    <li> As problems are recognized and you respond to to unanticipated events, 
    	 you will have to revise your plan to deal with them.  
	 Your plan too should also be maintained a a file
	 (e.g. <tt>plan_1.txt</tt>) in your repo.</li>
    <li> If deadlines are missed, or deliverables fail to pass review, 
         the fact, as well as the causes and the plan to remedy them must 
	 also be documented.</li>
</ul>
<P>
You can prepare and submit this plan in any form you like, but the sort
of information I had in mind was:

   MEETINGS AND PROGRESS MONITORING:

        We will have a face-to-face meeting every Tuesday after class to review 
        our plan for the week.

        We will have a 5 minute IRC chat each day at 8PM for a quick status check.
        Other working meetings will be scheduled as needed.

        If something goes wrong, send-email to the rest of the team THAT DAY.

	Zebulon will ensure that all of these are added to <tt>minutes.txt</tt>
	on a daily basis.
</pre>
<P>
Your initial Management Plan will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 40% good use of time and resources (work apportioned reasonably over the available time)
	<li> 20% specificity of plan (clear responsibilities: who, what, when)
	<li> 20% provisions for early detection of problems, and time to deal with them
	<li> 20% completeness
</ul>
</P>

<P>
Maintain your concept description on github.
Depending on format, you might prefer to keep your plan in Google Docs, but documenting the changes.
You will probably be updating them daily,
and we will be reviewing this history.
</P>
<P>
When you are ready to submit them for grading:
<ul>
    <li> prepare your proposal (ideally ASCII text in a file named <tt>proposal_1a.txt</tt>)</li>
    <li> prepare your management plan (<tt>management_1a.xxx</tt>, 
         where <tt>xxx</tt> is a format appropriate suffix)</li>
    <li> put a <a href="#submission">standard submission prologue</a> on the front of each file</li>
    <li> up-load them for submission (only one person on the team needs to do this)</li>
</ul>
</P>
<a name="desc_1b">
<H3>P1B - Competitive Research and Positioning</h3>
</a>
<P>
Before building a new software product, one should first study the
products that are already available:
<ul>
    <li> to understand the features they already provide.</li>
    <li> to understand how those features do and do not address users' needs.</li>
    <li> to learn lessons from the things they have done well.</li>
    <li> to learn lessons from the things they have done poorly.</li>
    <li> to understand what value could be added by creating a new program.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
Do research to identify existing products in your space
(or the closest existing products to a new space),
their capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses.
Identify <strong>multiple</strong> ways in which you could 
significantly improve on these products.  
(if you cannot significantly improve on existing products, 
then there is no need for a new one).
</P>
<P>
Start with a brief overview of your product-space, the way(s)
in which you seached for comparable offerings, and your rationale
for choosing the onces you choose to study more deeply.
</P>
<P>
Write up a brief description of the existing products, 
how they arose, how they are used,
and notes on their key strengths and weaknesses.
Note the (positive or negative) lessons you can learn 
(about either features or implementation)
from each of these products.
Write up a list of feasible and valuable improvements that you
could reasonably make in a new product, and briefly justify 
their value and practicality (e.g. why/how you should be able to do better).
</p>
<P>
Note that this is a list of ideas, and will be graded on 
organization, quality of analysis, and clarity of insight.
It will not be graded as prose (e.g. complete sentences).
</p>
<p>
Your research and analysis will be graded on the basis of:
<UL>
    <LI> 20% how well you found and described competing, similar
	 or related products.</li>
    <LI> 40% the depth, clarity and credibility which you understood and
	 described their capabilities.</li>
    <LI> 20% the depth and cogency of your comparison of their features
    	with the feature set that you propose.</li>
    <LI> 20% the value you gained from this research (features, approaches
         and ways in which your proposal could be improved).</li>
</UL>
<P>
Maintain your research report on github.
When you are ready to submit it for grading:
<ul>
    <li> prepare your report (ideally ASCII text in a file named <tt>report_1b.txt</tt>)</li>
    <li> put a <a href="#submission">standard submission prologue</a> on the front of it</li>
    <li> up-load it for submission (only one person on the team needs to do this)</li>
</ul>
</P>

<H3>P1C - Requirmenents Development</h3>
</a>
<P>
Clarity is power.
</p>
<p>
Many well-funded projects have failed because they did not deliver functionality that people
actually needed (or did not deliver it in a usable form).
Our success in building a new software product is a function of
how clearly we understand its intended functionality.  
Its success in satisfying its users is a function of how well
we understand their needs.
If we do not clearly understand what must be done, 
it will only be by accident that we do the right things.
Requirements Development is the (often ignored by developers)
process of developing those critical understandings. 
</P>
<P>
In this phase of the project you will:
<ul>
    <li> develop your own proposed list of product requirements. </li>
    <li> identify and characterize the types of users for which your product is intended. </li>
    <li> conduct <em>requirements elicitation</em> interviews with potential users.</li>
    <li> analyze the results of those interviews and develop a set of formal requirements for your project.</li>
</ul>

<a name="desc_1c1">
<H4>P1C.1 - Preliimnary Requirements</H4>
</A>
<P>
Brainstorm on your product concept and discuss the capabilities of
existing products to get ideas for what your product should
be able to do.
<br>
Identify different types of users who might have different
needs, and then identify capabilities, characteristics,
and/or use cases for each.  
</P>
<P>
The specific form in which you choose to represent these
requirements is up to you.  Basic capabilities may be best
captured by simple declarative sentences.  Complex or role
based interactions may be best captured by use cases.  Use
the forms that you think best captures the requirements in
question.
</P>
<P>
Again, there is no need for this document to be any more
than organized notes.
</P>
<P>
Your preliminary requrements document should include:
<ul>
    <li> the various types of people who might want to use your product.</li>
    <li> the goals that each user would have.</li>
    <li> the needs, expectations, and abilities (e.g. skills, computer experience)
         different types of users would bring.</li>
    <li> the types of users to which you feel best able to respond</li>
    <li> the requirements you think your product would need to meet to satisfy those customers</li>
</ul>

<P>
These requirements will be graded on the basis of:
<UL>
    <LI> 20% how well you understood who your users might be</li>
    <LI> 40% how well you anticipated their likely abilities and expectations</li>
    <LI> 40% how well you were able to capture these needs in requirements</li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
Maintain your requirements document on github.
When you are ready to submit it for grading:
<ul>
    <li> prepare your report (ideally ASCII text in a file named <tt>reqts_1c.txt</tt>)</li>
    <li> put a <a href="#submission">standard submission prologue</a> on the front of it</li>
    <li> up-load it for submission (only one person on the team needs to do this)</li>
</ul>
</P>

<a name="desc_1c2">
<H4>P1C.2 Concept Presentation</h4>
</a>
Before asking potential users for requirements suggestions, we have to give
them some idea of what we are talking about.  This should be a brief (five
minutes or less) presentation on the type of product being considered.
<strong>This is not a sales pitch!</strong>  
As we will discuss in our lecture on requirements,
it is crucial that we not contaminate the panel with our own thoughts.  The purpose
of a requirements elicitation is for us to get information from potential users.
As such, the presentation should be limited to establishing a context for the questions to follow.
</P>
<P>
A brief (3-6 minutes) prepared presentation (including slides and/or other visual aids)
introducing the product concept as  background for the requirements elicitation.
</P>
<P>
This presentation will be graded on:
<ul>
	<li> 40% its effectiveness in establishing context (the interviewees 
	     understand the form, purpose, and use of the intended product).</li>
	<li> 10% how effectively it stimulates interest in the product, making them
	     eager to provide input.</li>
	<li> 10% its length: 3-6 minutes</li>
	<li> 10% the extent to which it does not otherwise contaminate or prejudice the
	     panel members.</li>
	<li> 20% logical/information presentation structure.</li>
	<li> 10% how good an impression it makes (polished and professional).</li>
</ul>

<P>
This presentation will be given at the
start of your requirements elicitation session, but
any prepared materials (e.g. slides) must be prepared
and made available for review prior to the actual elicitation.
</P>
<P>
You may prepare and deliver this presentation in any 
form you choose, but the written submission should be 
in some relatively universal format (e.g. pdf, HTML,
Google Presentation).
<P>
Maintain your concept presentation on github (or in a Google Presentation with history).
<br>
When you are ready to submit it for grading:
<ul>
    <li> create a <a href="#submission">standard submission prologue</a> 
         (that includes a URL to the source or viewable slides/html) and
	 entitle it <tt>concept_1c.txt</tt></li>
    <li> up-load it for submission (only one person on the team needs to do this)</li>
</ul>
</P>

<a name="desc_1c3">
<H3>P1C.3 - Requirements Elicitation </h3>
</a>
<P>
As described in the Requirements lecture, there are many possible sources
of product requirements.  One of the most important sources is the intended
users.  The better we understand what they do, and how the proposed product
would be used, the better we can design a product to meet their needs.  
Each team will be asked to design and conduct a session in which they will
gather requirements information from potential users.
</P>
<P>
This is a ~30 minute face-to-face meeting with potential users where
you will gather information to develope and validate requirements. 
<OL>
    <li>
	Briefly (in less than 60 seconds) introduce yourselves and the agenda</li>
    <li>
	Give your concept presentation</li>
    <li>
	Start with open-ended information gathering about the relevant activities,
	how they pursue them, what problems they encounter, and what they wish they could do.</li>
    <li>
	Then move into more specific questions, following up on interesting points
	raised in the open-ended questions, and posing the more directly product-focused 
	questions that you have come up with.</li>
    <li>
	Get their comments on information you have gained from other sources.
	Note: It is possible that, in the process of giving you
	their own requirements, the customers will actually
	touch on all of your own previously gathered requirents.
	If this is the case, when you get to that part of the
	agenda, specifically affirm that they have reiterated
	(or how they have changed) that prior input.</li>
    <li>
	Present a summary of the key messages you have gotten from them today, 
	and give them the opportunity to correct/amend those.</li>
    <li>
	Thank them for their participation.</li>
</ol>

<b> Team roles: </b>
<ul>
    <li> Moderator:  Leads the meeting, discussions, etc.</li>
    <li> Scribe: Takes notes</li>
    <li> Others: <br>
	All team members will play important parts in making this a success.
	The moderator and scribe will typically be too busy to actually
	think about and process what is being said in real time.
	Other team members should
	<ul>
	    <li>
		Distill long discussions into punch-lines for the summary.</li>
	    <li> 
		Keep track of points that need further clarification before we are done.</li>
	    <li> 
		Check off comments that relate to previously suggested requirements, 
		and maintain a list of requirements that still require validation.</li>
	    <li> Watch the agenda and the clock,
		 and help the moderator keep to the agenda and 
		 make sure that nothing is missed (because it is very
		 difficult to think while talking).</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<P>
This process will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 25% the extent to which you are able to adhere to the process (which will be described,
	     in the reading, given to you in writing, and demonstrated in class).</li>
	<li> 50% the extent to which you are able to obtain and digest useful information from 
	     the panel about their activities, needs and perceptions in this area.</li>
	<li> 25% the extent to which you are able to confirm the correctness of your
	     understandings and validate/clarify prior assumptions and questions about requirements.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
When you have identified a panel of potential users, schedule an appointment
(with me or a grader) for your requirements elicitation session.
</P>

<a name="desc_1c4">
<H3>P1C.4 - Elicitation Report and Requrements Analysis</H3>
</a>
<P>
After the elicitation session, scribe should write up 
a summary report, review it with the team, and add it to your repo.
This report should include:
<ul>
    <li> When and where the session took place and who attended.</li>
    <li> Interesting information gained during the open-ended
	information gathering.</li>
    <li> Clear statements of significant new requirements that 
	were suggested, along with an assessment of how important 
	each is and why.</li>
    <li> Significant input on previously gathered requirements,
	affirming, refuting, or changing them.</li>
    <li>Any other useful results gained from the meeting.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
This report will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 20% form (capturing who, when where, topic)</li>
	<li> 20% completeness (all key points captured)</li>
	<li> 20% the clarity, organization and readability of the report</li>
	<li> 20% understanding what the customer said (correctly, and deeply)</li>
	<li> 20% a summary that captures the key input</li>
</ul>
<P>
When you are ready to submit your elicitation report for grading:
<ul>
    <li> prepare your report (ideally ASCII text in a file named <tt>report_1c.txt</tt>)</li>
    <li> put a <a href="#submission">standard submission prologue</a> on the front of it</li>
    <li> up-load it for submission (only one person on the team needs to do this)</li>
</ul>
</P>

<P>
The characteristics of good requirements are discussed in both
the reading and the lecture on requirements.  Starting with
your initial (brain-stormed) requirements:
<OL type=1>
   <LI> revise them based on customer feedback (and your
	evolving understanding of the problem)</li>
   <LI>	add the new requirements gathered from customers.</li>
   <LI> look for ambiguous requirements, and clarify them.</li>
   <LI> assign a value (e.g. high/medium/low) to each requirement, 
   	and justify that assignment.</li>
   <LI> assign a confidence (e.g. high/medium/low) to each requirement
   	(that you have properly understood it and/or its value).</li>
   <LI> look for conflicting requirements, and resolve the
	conflicts.</li>
   <LI> assign a difficulty (easy, moderate, hard) to each,
	and justify your assignment.</li>
   <LI> assign a priority (e.g. must-have, should-have, nice-to-have)
        (based on the compbination of value and difficulty)
   	to each requirement, and then ladder them by priority.</li>
   <LI> suggest a cut-off line for release 1.0, and justify
	why that is the right place to draw the line.</li>
</OL>
</P>
<P>
When you sit down to come up with a final set of requirements, 
it is likely that you will discover that some of the input
you got in your elicitation was not as clear as it seemed at
the time.  When this happens, you have a few options:
<UL>
   <LI>	If it is unclear, go back to the person from whom you got the requirement
	and seek clarification.</li>
   <LI> If there are contradictions, understand why different people have
        different needs, and see if there is a way to satisfy both (or give
	up on one set of users).</li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
Based on the results of your requirements analysis, prepare a priority 
ordered list of product requirements.  For each, list:
<ul>
	<li> the stated requirement</li>
	<li> its priority, and your justification for that determination</li>
	<li> its difficulty, and your basis for that assessment</li>
	<li> your confidence in that requirement, and where it came from</li>
</ul>
</P>
The requirements analysis will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 40% completeness of the lists and traceability of the requirements
	     (e.g. to user input or existing standards).
	</li>
	<li> 20% reasonablness/appropriateness of the requirements</li>
	<li> 20% prioritization and rationale for that prioritization</li>
	<li> 20% clarity, organizatin and readability of the report</li>
</ul>
<P>
Maintain your requirements analysis on github.
When you are ready to submit it for grading:
<ul>
    <li> prepare your report (ideally ASCII text in a file named <tt>analysis_1c.txt</tt>)</li>
    <li> put a <a href="#submission">standard submission prologue</a> on the front of it</li>
    <li> up-load it for submission (only one person on the team needs to do this)</li>

<H3>P1D - Final Proposal and Post Mortem</H3>
</a>
<P>
Having thought about what you want to build, describing it to others,
and getting their feedback, you should now be prepared to:
<OL type="a">
    <LI> write up a proper proposal for your project.</li>
    <LI> assess how this process went, and what you have learned from it.</li>
</ol>
</P>
<a name="desc_1d1">
<H4>P1D.1 - Final Proposal</H4>
The key deliverable is a written proposal (likely to management or a granting agency)
about why they should approve (or fund) this project: 
</a>
<UL>
    <LI> It should include an overview of the problem space and concept.</li>
    <LI> It should describe the key types of users and the needs to which your proposal responds.</li>
    <LI> It should include competitive positioning information.</li>
    <LI> It should include validation (from your customer interviews or other research) 
         that your proposal responds to a real need and would be a compelling product.</li>
    <LI> It should include a list of key requirements the product must satisfy
    	 (and why these requirements can be trusted).</li>
    <LI> It should include some basis for believing this project to be feasible
         for implementation (given enough time) by this team.</li>
</UL>
<P>
Most of this information has already been assembled (in your initial proposal, 
competitive analysis, concept presentation and requirements analysis).  
Now you are assembling it into a final form.
</p>

<B>Hints (about the real world):</B>
<UL>
	The <em>director</em> to whom you are submitting this proposal can be
	viewed as another type of user, with her own sets of needs.
	Your product need not respond to your director's needs ... 
	but your proposal (if it is to be successful) must do so!
	This means you need some idea of who your director is, what
	constraints she is under, and what problems she is trying to solve.
	<P>
	Note that executives (even R&D directors) are very busy, and
	often suffer from short attention spans ... so brief and to-the-point 
	is generally better than long and elaborate.
</UL>

<P>
This proposal will be graded much more on content than on format, so ASCII
text is completely acceptable.  If you want to submit it in a
richer format (e.g. so you can include images), PDF, Googledocs,
or HTML are also acceptable.
</P>
<P>
This proposal will be graded on the basis of:
<UL>
   <LI> 20% clarity problem domain and cogency of the concept</LI>
   <LI> 20% clarity and depth of the target user descriptions</LI>
   <LI> 10% clarity, depth, authoritativeness, cogency of the competitive analysis</LI>
   <LI> 20% clarity and persuasiveness of the value proposition</LI>
   <LI> 10% clarity, prioritization, provenance of the key requirements</LI>
   <LI> 10% likelihood that I would fund this effort
   	(because I believe it can be built and will address a real need)</LI>
   <LI> 10% likelihood that I would hire the people who prepared this report
        (because of the depth and clarity of the analysis and presentation)</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Maintain your final proposal on github (or in a GoogleDoc with history enabled).
When you are ready to submit it for grading:
<ul>
    <li> prepare your report proposal_1d.txt</tt> (or <tt>.pdf</tt>)</li>
    <li> put a <a href="#submission">standard submission prologue</a> on the front of it</li>
    <li> up-load it for submission (only one person on the team needs to do this)</li>

<H4>P1D.2 - Post-Mortem Analysis</H4>
</a>
This project is a learning exercise, and one of the major ways
we learn is by analyzing past mistakes.  You will, as a team,
review all aspects of this project.  One of you will then 
summarize that process into a post-mortem analysis report.
</P>
<P>
A report, summarizing the key issues raised in your post-mortem,
and the conclusions you came to.  Your post-mortem discussion 
should include:
<ul>
	<li> the concept definition, research, and brainstorming activities</li>
	<li> the customer requirements elicitation planning, execution, and results analysis</li>
	<li> the organization and creation of the final proposal</li>
	<li> the planning and ongoing management of these activities</li>
	<li> the overall project as an educational exercise.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
The submission and grading of Post Mortem reports is described
in the <a href="#postmortem">General Grading</a> information.
<P>
Make sure that you have kept your meeting minutes and management plan up-to-date on Github.
When you are ready to submit the Post-Mortem report (and management notes) for grading:
<ul>
    <li> prepare your report (ideally ASCII text in a file named <tt>postmortem_1.txt</tt>)</li>
    <li> put a <a href="#submission">standard submission prologue</a> on the front of it</li>
    <li> make sure that it also contains Github URLs for your meeting minutes and management plans</li>
    <li> up-load it for submission (only one person on the team needs to do this)</li>
</ul>
</P>

<H4>P1D.3 - Work Share Estimates</H4>
<p>
Most of your grade for this project will be based on the team deliverables, but some of it will
be based on the quality, amount, and timeliness of work done by each team member.  Towards this
end, we ask each team member to estimate the
<a href="#work_share">amount of work</a> done by each team member on this project.
Please prepare your own assessment of how much work was done by whom and submit it as
<tt>workshare_1.txt</tt> (or perhaps <tt>workshare_1.csv</tt>).
