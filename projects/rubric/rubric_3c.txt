    Component Design		___/20

	externals 		___/8
	
		___	all external methods well enough described that you know how to code them (4pt)

		___	all methods and instance variables well enough described that you would
			know, as a client, how to use them. (2pt)

		___	all instance variables well enough described that you know how to declare,
			initialize, AND UPDATE THEM CORRECTLY.

		___	fully implements the component interface specification


	internal methods	___/2	(if none, use the external scores)

		___	all internal methods well enough described that you known how to code them


		___	it is clear why each exists, and they seem reasonably defined


		___	no missing pieces


	algorithms/approach	___/8

		___	design includes sufficent algorithmic complexity (4pt)


		___	the overall structure and approach make sense (having read the rationale)


		___	proposed implementation seems correct & reasonable (not unnecessarily complex)


		___	proposed algorithms and approaches seem reasonably efficient


		___	proposed approaches reasonably exploit language/tool capabilities


	general			___/2
