Given your specifications, designs, and test plans, conducting design reviews
with your team-mates should be relatively quick and easy.  But, over the next
week, you will each have to:
   * study for and participate in three other reviews
   * write up a report on your own review
   * understand and work any issues that are raised in your own review

I suggest that you get together, as a team, as soon as possible and lay out
a schedule to spread that work out over the next week, leaving enough time 
to deal with the issues that arise in those reviews.
