Project 1B - Competitive Research and Positioning

Now that you have chosen a product to work on this semester, the next step
is to do some research into that space, understand what others have already
done, and clarify what makes the software you propose to build better
(or more useful) than what is currently available.  Such research (and
positioning) should be fundmental to any new software development effort,
whether personal, academic or commercial.  Before you start exploring 
a new space, learn everything you can from the people who have gone
there before you.

I would encourage you all to quickly do any sorts of searches that seem
likely, and have a team meeting (Monday or early Tuesday) where you 
   * combine your lists
   * decide which are worthy of further investigation
   * divide those among the team members

It would be very good if you had completed your research, written
up your notes, and (as a team) discussed them and what they suggest
for your own proposal before Friday's lab session.
