Having completed your architectural reviews, you should now have a clear
list of issues to be addressed:

In the next week you will:
   * review the results of your architectural review (both your own notes and
     the report from the reviewing team)
   * research and identify design changes to address those issues
   * confirm the reasonableness of those results with the reviewing team
   * write up a revised architectural proposal in which you specifically
     identify those issues and the way in which each has been addressed

I suggest that you schedule your follow-up meeting with the other team
as soon as possible, to ensure that you will be able to get their feedback
before doing the work to make those changes.
