We, as software developers, have a vision of what we propose to build.  But,
unless we are building this purely for our own education or amusement, we
would be well advised to get feedback from intended users about
   * what they currently do in this area
   * what new capabilities or conveniences they want
   * how they might see themselves using the software you propose

The criticality of user input and clear requirements may be one of the few
areas where Big-Project and Agile methodologies agree!

In the next week you will:
   * brain-storm (based on competitive resaeach and your own ideas)
     functional requirements for the software you are proposing.
   * conduct a requirements elicitation session with potential users.
   * analyze the results to develop and write-up a set of formal requirements.

I would encourage you to ASAP (before Tuesday):
   1. discuss what kinds of people would be most likely to use your software.
   2. identify a few such people (possibly but not necessarily other students).
   3. contact them and schedule a group requirements elicitation session
      (before Friday's lab session).
