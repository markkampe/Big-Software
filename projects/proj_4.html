<H2>1. Introduction</h2>
</a>

The first three projects took us through all of the activities that precede
implementation.  In this final project you will actually implement the components
you designed in project 3 ... and by now it should come as little surprise to you
that only part of your time will be spent coding, and (if you do it right) very 
little of your time will be spent debugging.
<P>

<A name="desc">
<H2>2. Major Activities and Deliverables</h2>
</a>
<P>
The major activities in this project are:
<ol type=1>
	<li><b>Implement your components</b><br> 
		Each of you will implement the component you designed in project 3.
	<li><b>Pair Programming exercise</b><br> 
		Two of you will spend (at least) one session doing pair-programming
		on one of these components, after which you will write a brief
		(joint) report on the experience.
	<li><b>Test Driven Development</b><br>
		(at least) one of you will develop your component in a Test Driven
		fashion (implementing and running tests as you complete each routine
		or feature), and then write a brief report on the experience.
	<li><b>Code Review</b><br>
		(at least) one of you will implement your component and then submit
		it for code review by the other members of your team.  The reviewers
		will submit their notes, and the reviewee will write a brief report
		on the experience.
	<li><b>Test Suite</b><br>
		Each of you will implement the component test plan you designed in
		project 3, and use it to validate the correctness of your component
		implementation.
	<li><b>Sprint Review/Demo</b><br>
		You will, as a team, prepare a brief sprint review:
		<UL>
		   <LI> describing the components you implemented and their functionality
		   <LI> demonstrating a successful build and test execution for each
			component
		   <LI> demonstrating the functionality of the combined set of components.
		   <LI> summarizing your key accomplishments and what progress this
			represents for the (greater) project.
		</UL>
	<li><b>Post Mortem</b> <br>
		You will, as a tream, review the process you followed in this project
		to see what lessons you can learn for how to do things more effectively
		in the future.
</ol>
Each member of the team must incorporate one of the three development exercises
(Pair Programming, Test Driven Development, or Code Review) into his/her
implemenation, and all team members will participate in at least on code 
review.
<P>
You may note that there is no management plan or grade associated with this
project.  You should, by now be able to plan and coordinate activities for
yourselves, and you are already being graded on your ability to deliver the 
required work on schedule ... which is the point.


<a name="desc_1">
<H3>2.1 Final Code</h3>
</a>

The primary activity in this project is for each person to implement
and test the component they designed in project 3.  There will be
many processes and exercises surrounding this implementation, but
the primary deliverable is working code that implements the requirements
and specifications set out in project 3.

<H4>2.1.1 Deliverables</h4>

Source files and instructions/scripts (e.g. ant/makefile) required to build them.
Also include the specifications and design for this component (from project 3,
with any changes you have made since then).

<a name="grade_1">
<H4>2.1.2 Grading</h4>
</a>

This submission be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 10% appropriateness of chosen languages and frameworks
	<li> 20% completeness relative to project 3 design and specifications
	<li> 20% how well it corresponds to the (revised) design
	<li> 20% code quality (idioms, simplicity, efficiency)
	<li> 20% code understandability (structure, layout, comments)
	<li> 10% grader is able to build it from source
</ul>

<a name="sub_1">
<H4>2.1.3 Submission</h4>
</a>

After you have completed all of your implementation and testing, and
you believe your code is entirely complete, fill
out the following form and e-mail it to the submission alias.

<PRE>

</PRE>

<a name="desc_2">
<H3>2.2 Pair Programming Exercise</h3>
</a>

At least one member of the team will ask another member to join
them for at least one pair-programming session.  How you divide
up your effort (think/code, code/review, code/test) is entirely
up to you, and you are welcome to try various approaches.
<P>
For all work done in a pair-programming mode, the commit comments
should reflect the division of responsibilities under which that
work was done.
<P>
NOTE: what ever component this is done for should not also be used
for code review or Test Driven Development.

<H4>2.2.1 Deliverables</h4>

After the end of each pair-programming session, each of the
people involved should jot down notes on what happened.  After
the component has been completed, the two people should get
together and write up a report on the experience.  This report
should cover:
<UL>
   <li>	what role divisions you tried and how you decided how to organize those activities.
   <li> how effectively each persons time was used (with each division of roles).
   <li> the speed of code development, vs working alone.
   <li> the quality of the code, vs working alone.
   <li> pleasant or unpleasant aspects of the experience.
   <li> how you would do this differently next time.
</UL>

<a name="grade_2">
<H4>2.2.2 Grading</h4>
</a>

This activity and report be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 20% documentation of collaboration in commit comments
	<li> 20% reasonable role divisions, reasonably carried out
	<li> 20% amount of work accomplished in this mode
	<li> 20% quality of work accomplished in this mode
	<li> 20% reasonable insights into the process
</ul>

<a name="desc_3">
<H3>2.3 Code Review</h3>
</a>

At least one member of the team will write all of his/her code,
and before running test suites against it, submit that code for
review by the other members of their team.  The other team members
will study the code, prepare, nodes and conduct a formal code review,
producing a report with must-fix/should-fix/advice items.
<P>
The author will make the appropriate revisions, and then move on
to testing.  After the code is working, the author will write
up a report on the process.
<P>
NOTE: What ever component this is done for should not also be used for
TDD or pair programming.

<H4>2.3.1 Deliverables</h4>

The author will prepare a review package containing the component 
requirements, specifications, and design (from project 3), and the
implementing code.
<P>
Each of the other team members will review that package and prepare
written notes, which will be checked in to github prior to the review.
<P>
After the review, a formal report will be prepared (listing all important
conclusions) and checked in to github.
<P>
After completing testing, the author will write a report addressing the
following questions:
<UL>
   <LI>	how valuable the input received from the code review process was, 
  	and what kinds of problems it turned up.
   <li> what kinds of problems remainined in the code after the code
	review process.
   <li> the relative merits of doing code review before or after testing.
   <li> would knowing that you were going to have a code review have
     	caused you to make any changes to your test plan?
   <LI> how would you do this differently next time?

<a name="desc_4">
<H3>2.4 Test Driven Development</h3>
</a>

At least one member of the team will use Test Driven Development to
implement his/her component, building and running the test cases for 
each increment of code as the new code is added.   The rewards for 
this approach should be:
<OL type="a">
   <LI> the there should be little debugging to do, and what little 
	there is should be quite simple.
   <LI>	by the time the coding is done, most of the testing will also be done.
</OL>
But it will require the test framework to be working first, and more up-front 
planning about the order in which things should be implemented.  Check in this
plan before you start coding.
As evidence that you did infact follow a TDD process, and for keeping a
record of the problems found, commit each new increment of code prior to
running the associated tests, and make sure to commit the tests and any
changes to that code before starting on the next increment of code.
<P>
NOTE: What ever component this is done for should not also be used for
code review or pair programming.
<P>

<H4>2.4.1 Deliverables</h4>

After completing development, the/each person who uses this methodology
will write a brief report, covering what they did, and specifically addressing
the following questions:
<UL>
   <LI>	how the implementation order was decided, and how that order worked.
   <LI> the efficiency of the process was (e.g. how much time went into building
 	test cases that were only useful during the construction process).
   <LI> to what extent do you believe that knowing how you were going to
	test the code caused you to write code that was more correct?
   <LI> were there bugs that showed up later that were not found by the
	TDD process?
   <LI> how would you do this differently next time?
</UL>

<a name="grade_4">
<H4>2.4.2 Grading</h4>
</a>

This activity and report be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
   <li>	10% a reasonable plan for implementation order
   <li> 30% tests were written and passed incrementally (from the commit history)
   <li> 20% each test meaningfully validated the associated code (from the commit history)

<H3>2.5 Final Test Suite</h3>
</a>

Each team member will, for his/her component, implment the 
test plan proposed in project 3, and run those tests against
their component implementation.

<H4>2.5.1 Deliverables</h4>

Each team member should submit:
<UL>
   <LI>	a reference to your (perhaps updated) test plan from project 3.
   <LI>	the code that implements your test suite (and tools you needed to build).
   <LI>	the output of having run that test suite against your component.
</UL>
It is quite likely that you will, as a result of lessons learned during 
the implementation, decide you want to change your test plan.  If this
happens (a) update your project 3 test plan and (b) submit a summary of
and explanations for the changes.

<H3>2.6 Sprint Review/Demo</h3>
</a>

At the end of each SCRUM sprint, the team presents the work that was
completed during that sprint to the product owner.  This is, in part,
ceremonial (the team can claim success and receive feedback on the
work they have completed) but it also a very practical sign-off:
<UL>
    <LI> the team briefly reviews the requirements to have been
	 met and demonstrates that the product now meets them.
    <LI> the team overviews the testing that has been done.
    <LI> the product owner decides whether or not this work
         has actually been completed (i.e. deliverable
         functionality).
    <LI> velocity points are only earned for accepted work.
</UL>
<P>
You have built your components, and your test suite, and you have
run your tests.  Hopefully you have been able to combine your
components and demonstrate functionality for the integrated whole.
Now it is time for you to review what you have produced with your
product owner.

<H4>2.6.1 Deliverables</h4>
Your review presentation should include:
<UL>
   <LI>	a brief summary of the functionality of each of the components
	built during this sprint and the (component level) requirements
	it was to meet.
   <LI>	a brief overview of the scope of the automated testing plan for
	each component.
   <LI>	a brief overview of the expected functionality of the integrated
	pieces.
   <LI>	a demonstration of an (error-free) build and automated test of each 
	component (according to that test plan).
   <LI>	a demonstration of the functionality of the combined pieces.
   <LI> a summary of what progress this represents towards the construction
	of your larger project (what this means and what comes next).
</UL>
This is not a long presentation.  It might be useful to have slides to cover
the components, their requirements, and their test plans, but this is not
necessary.   The only required demonstration is working code, and a 4-5
minute presentation will be fine.

<H3>2.7 Post-Mortem Report</H3>
</a>
This project is a learning exercise, and one of the major ways
we learn is by analyzing past mistakes.  You will, as a team,
review all aspects of this project.  One of you will then 
summarize that process into a post-mortem analysis report.
<P>
<H4>2.7.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
A report, summarizing the key issues raised in your post-mortem,
and the conclusions you came to.  Your post-mortem discussion 
should include:
<ul>
	<li> the implementation of your component design and the resulting code quality
	<li> the implementation of your test plan, the problems found, and the confidence gained
	<li> the relative efficacy of the competing development processes
	<li> the integration of your components together

<H3>3.1 Due Dates and Slip Days</H3>
</a>
<P>
Any assignment that is not turned in by its <strong>due date</strong>,
will have its grade reduced by 10% (of its nominal value) for each
late day.  I understand that problems happen, and so each student is
granted three <em>slip days</em>.  A team of four students would have
twelve slip days between them.
<P>
One slip-day will excuse <strong>one</strong> deliverable 
being late by <strong>one</strong> day.   
If a design is one day late, and that delays the
design review by a day, then you may find that you need two slip-days.  
Don't make the mistake of using up your slip-days too soon, because
the pressures generally get tighter later in the course. 
<P>
When a team needs to use slip-days, they need to decide who's
days they are using.  However you decide is OK with me, but
we will be tracking the slip days per student.
If will be using any slip days on a deliverable, tell me in 
advance that you will be doing so (so that I don't nag you
about whether or not I lost your submission message).

<A name="primary">
<H3>3.1 Primary Authorship</h3>
</A>
While many activities (e.g. Post Mortem review) are fundamentally team
activities, each major work product will typically have a primary author:
one person who works up the basic organization, pulls together the contribution
from the other team members and writes most of the prose.
<P>
The ability to organize large collections of information into a coherent
narrative is an important skill, and each team members should take primary
authorship for multiple work products.  The quality portion of the individual
contribution grade is based on the work products for which that person was
the primary author (presided over a process, or wrote at least 2/3 of
the text in a document).
<P>
Each work product submission must include an indication of the
primary author (or authors if no individual produced 2/3 of the text).
Note, however, that since the whole team will be graded
on the quality of each work product, it is only prudent
for the entire team to review any high-value work product 
before it is submitted.

<P>
I will keep these as confidential, and average them together to get a sense
of the individual contributions to each team's efforts.
<P>
<h3>3.2 Collaboration and Citation</a></h3>
<p>
This is a team project, but different individuals will have primary
responsibility for different processes or work products (or different
