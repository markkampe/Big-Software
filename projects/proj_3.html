<H2>1. Introduction</h2>
</a>

The first two projects were largely team activities.  In the next two projects
you will do much of your work as individuals, tho with considerable assistance
from other team members.  Each member of the team will (over the next two projects)
be responsible for the design and implementation of one piece from your architecture.
Depending on your architecture, these could each be a complete architectural component,
or small pieces (e.g. an applet or a few classes) from a single architectural component.  
Choose your pieces carefully:
<UL>
   <li> each of the chosen pieces should be somewhere in the range of 100-400 lines of code.
   <li> each person must be capable of independently building and testing his/her own piece.
   <li> each of these pieces must be testable in isolation.
   <li> when you are done, it should be possible to combine all
	of these individual pieces together to create a working 
	(all the pieces working together) and demo-able component.
</UL>
Your pieces can be implemented in any language or combination of languages, 
and use any tool-kits or middle-ware you find convenient ... but it must be 
code (not HTML or images).
<P>
In this project you will create specifications, designs and testing plans
for the chosen pieces.
In the next (and final) project you will execute these plans, building, 
testing, integrating, and demonstrating working software.
<P>
<A name="desc">
<H2>2. Major Activities and Deliverables</h2>
</a>
<P>
There are several major parts to this project, each of which has its
own goals, processes, and deliverables:
<ol type=1>
	<li><b>Initial Plan</b><br> 
		You will, as a team, select the pieces to be designed 
		and implemented, and develop a plan for this project, 
		dividing the work over your team members and the available time.  
	<li><b>Component Specifications</b><br> 
    		You will, as a team, elaborate the architecture above 
		the chosen pieces sufficiently to generate detailed 
		specifications for the pieces.  You will then write
		up detailed component specifications for each of the 
		pieces to be designed in this project.
	<li><b>Detailed Component Design </b><br> 
		You will, as individuals, prepare a detailed design for
		one of the selected pieces.
	<li><b>Unit Testing Plan</b><br>
		You will, as individuals, prepare a detailed unit testing
		plan for the piece that you have designed.
	<li><b>Submit for Review</b><br>
		You will, as individuals, package your specifications, 
		design, and test plan, and submit it for a design review
		by the other members of your team.
	<li><b>Design Review</b><br>
		You will, for each submitted package:
		<UL>
		    <li> as individuals, study the package and prepare notes.
		    <li> as a team, conduct a formal design review.
		    <li> one team member will write up the results of that reivew.
		</UL>
	<li><b>Revision and Final Designs</b><br>
		You will, as individuals, revise your designs and plans
		to address all important issues raised in the design review.
	<li><b>Post Mortem</b> <br>
		You will, as a team, review the processes you followed in
		this project to see what lessons you can learn for how
		to do things more effectively in the future.
	<li><b>Project Management </b><br> 
		All of the above will be planned, documented, and managed.
</ol>

<a name="desc_1">
<H3>2.1 Plan</h3>
</a>
The amount of work required to refine your architecture to the point that
it is possible to identify and specify your chosen components will vary
greatly from one project to the next, and I would encourage you to get
this behind you as quickly as possible.  Once you have a sense of what
the chosen components are, you should have a pretty good idea of how much
work it will be to do the designs and test plans.  You should, however,
leave yourself ample time for discovering issues in the review process
and making the required changes.

<H4>2.1.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
Each team will prepare a task-breakdown, identify the dependency relationships between
tasks, and owners for each sub-task, assign due-dates, and schedule regular reviews
of both work-products and progress (to enable adequate time to deal with the
problems that <strong>will</strong> happen).  
A good management plan will include regular status
checks, the results of which should be recorded in the plan document.
<P>
As your understanding of the problem
evolves and you respond to unanticipated events, 
you will have to revise your plan (not merely estimates, but
the work to be done).  Make sure that you document each of these
problems and the manner in which you decide to respond to it.
If deadlines are missed, or deliverables fail to pass review, the fact, as well
as the causes and the plan to remedy them must be documented.

<a name="grade_1">
<H4>2.1.2 Grading</h4>
</a>

Your initial Management Plan will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 40% good use of time and resources (work apportioned reasonably over the available time)
	<li> 20% specificity of plan (clear responsibilities: who, what, when)
	<li> 20% provisions for early detection of problems, and time to deal with them
	<li> 20% completeness
</ul>

<a name="sub_1">
<H4>2.1.3 Submission</h4>
</a>

Maintain your plan on github. 
You will surely be updating it, and we will be reviewing your history
(changes and comments) to see how you dealt with problems.
When you are ready to submit it for grading, fill
out the following form and e-mail it to the submission alias.

<a name="desc_2">
<H3>2.2 Component Specifications</h3>
</a>
Each team member will take ownership of one or more components.
To prepare a component specifications, you will:
<UL>
  <li> expand the architecture (above those components) to describe
	those components and the components with which they interact.
	<P>
	Assuming that you have decided to implement pieces of your system that
	are smaller than complete architectural components (from project 2), 
	you will have to expand and refine that architecture down to the 
	level of the pieces you want to use for projects 3 and 4.  Note that
	you do not have to expand everything in your architecture to this
	level of detail.  You only have to do a top-down refinement along
	the path to the components you will be using for this project.
  <li> generally describe the functionality of each of the components
	to be designed, and its role in the overall architecture.
  <li> determine the requirements to be imposed on the components to
      	be designed, based on the product requirements they implement,
	and their role in the overall architecture.
  <li> characterize the external interfaces between the components to be
	designed and the rest of the system.
  <li> describe those interfaces and the required functionality with 
	sufficient clarity and specificity as to be a complete set
	of acceptance criteria.
</UL>
<P>

<H4>2.2.1 Deliverables</h4>

A specification will be prepared for each component to be designed and
implemented in projects 3 and 4.  Each component specification should
include:
<OL type="1">
    <li>
	An addendum to the (Project 2) architectural description
	filling in any additional context required for the new
	component descriptions.
	<p>
	It is quite possible that a single addendum (created by the
	entire team) can be used for all of the component specifications.
    <LI>
	A general description of the component and its role in the system.
    <LI>
	A complete specification of all external interfaces to this component
	(both form and functionality).
    <LI>
	A complete set of requirements that must be satisfied by this component.
</OL>

<a name="grade_2">
<H4>2.2.2 Grading</h4>
</a>

This submission be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 10% reasonableness and understandability of the architectural
		addendum (if any).
	<li> 10% reasonableness and understandability of the components 
		role in the overall system.
	<li> 10% reasonablness and understanability of the component functionality
	<li> 20% completeness of the external interface specifications
	<li> 20% reasonableness of the external interface specifications
	<li> 10% abstraction and modularity of the component definition
	<li> 20% completeness, reasonableness, and measurability of the requirements
</ul>

</PRE>

<a name="desc_3">
<H3>2.3 Component Design</h3>
</a>

Each team member will prepare a detailed design for one or 
more modules, ideally comprising 100-400 lines of code when complete.  
This design need not be at the level of complete pseudo-code, but 
(in combination with the specifications) should be sufficient to 
enable a skilled programmer to easily implement the specified module(s).
<P>
Each module design should include:
<UL>
   <LI> a description of the purpose of this module.
   <LI> complete declarations for all public methods and instance variables.
   <LI> complete declarations for all private methods and instance variables.
   <LI> declarations for all private routines.
   <LI> descriptions of purposes for all methods/routines.
   <LI> descriptions and meanings for all parameters.
   <LI> descriptions and uses of all data structures.
   <LI> descriptions and uses of all public and non-trivial private variables
	(where trivial variables would be things like loop indexes,
	saved values, and intermediate results)
   <LI> general descriptions of all non-obvious algorithms.
	These need not be pseudo code, but could simply be 
	descriptions of an approach (e.g. "allocate from the heap",
	"bubble-sort" or "compute SHA1 hash").  If a named
	algorithm is used, provide a reference to a description
	of its implementation (in case the programmer who will implement
	it isn't familiar with it).
   <LI> where the code is to be based on standard libraries,
	call those out (e.g. "synchronization will be with
	boost thread shared locks") and include a reference to
	the documentation for the functions to be used.
</UL>

If any of these design elements are non-obvious, the rationale 
for those decisions should be described so that the implementer
can better understand what they are to do.  People are more likely
to make mistakes when working on things they do not understand.
<P>
<H4>2.3.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
You can prepare your designs in any form you find convenient,
but you will probably find it easiest to create them as
code modules with compilable declarations, extensive comments,
and very little actual code.  Overview and rationale can be
presented as comments in front of the described elements.

<a name="grade_3">
<H4>2.3.2 Grading</h4>
</a>

This design be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 20% all external methods and instance variables are 
		described well enough to enable a skilled programmer
		figure out how to use them correctly.
	<li> 20% all implementations and internal methods are 
		described well enough to enable a skilled programmer
		to implement them (with no more research than having
		to read the referenced documentation).
	<li> 15% all variables and data structures are described
		well enough to enable a skilled programmer to use
		and update them correctly.
	<li> 10% the reasonableness (after having read the rationale)
		of the specified implementations.
	<li> 10% the completeness of the descriptions (no major questions,
		and all required documentation references are provided).
	<li> 10% the correctness of the described implementations.
	<li>  5% the simplicity (relative to the problem) of the proposed implementations.
	<li>  5% the likely efficiency of the described implementations.
	<li>  5% the readability of the design document (and referenced documentation).
</ul>

<a name="sub_3">

</PRE>

<a name="desc_4">
<H3>2.4 Test Plan</h3>
</a>

Once you have specifications and a design to satisfy them, you have
to figure out how you will test your implementation, to ascertain
that it actually works.
<UL>
   <LI>
	Review your specifications, and develop a set of automated comprehensive
	(black box) test cases to determine whether or not your component meets 
	its requirements.
   <LI>
	Review your design, and consider any possible/plausible component
	misbehavior that would not be detected by the the above-described
	acceptance tests.  If you find such behavior, define additional
	(white box) test cases to exercise and validate those situations.
	If there is no possible mis-behavior not covered by the acceptance
	criteria, you can earn the white-box points by offering a convincing
	proof of this assertion.
   <LI>
	Consider your component's interfaces and all of the above test
	cases, and design a means for performing all of those test cases
	in a fully automated fashion ... ideally using an existing
	unit testing framework (to structure your test case implementations,
	invoke them, and collect the results).

   <LI>
	Review the overall list for completeness (is everything covered),
	efficiency (are there redundant tests) and value (are there
	tests for things that don't matter or will never happen), and
	try to optimize out the low-value tests.  If the optimizations
	are not obvious, you should document these decisions in your test plan.
</UL>
It is likely that, in the process of developing your test plan, you
assertions that are hard to measure, or functionality that is difficult
to verify (or verify automatically).  If this happens, you may need to
revisit your requirements, specifications and design.

<H4>2.4.1 Deliverables</h4>

Your test plan should include:
<UL>
   <LI>	
	A general overview of the functionality to be verified,
	and the general approach(es) that will be taken to verification.
   <LI>
	An index of test cases.
   <LI>
	A description of the framework under which this testing will be performed.
   <LI>
	A complete list of test cases ... for each:
	<UL>
	    <LI> a brief summary of the assertion to be tested
	    <LI> the justification for including this test case
	    <LI> any special set-up required to run this test
	    <LI> how the situation to be tested will be generated
	    <LI> how correctness of behavior will be ascertained
	    <LI> any special clean-up required after this test
	</UL>
</UL>

Each member of the team will submit his preliminary specifications,
design and test plans for review by the other team members.  Each
team member will participate in the reviews of the designs and plans
submitted by the other members of his/her team.

<H4>2.5.1 Deliverables</h4>

Prior to each review meeting, each of you (individually) will read
the submitted specifications, designs, and test plan and prepare detailed notes
on all questions and concerns.  These notes must be submitted at
least 24 hours prior to the actual review session.  They should be
neat notes, describing legitimate issues clearly enough to be sent
as email, and organized for discussion (e.g. in the recommended 
review order).

<H3>2.6 Review and Report</h3>
</a>

Your team will conduct a formal design review for each submitted
Specification/Design/Test Plan package.  The process will be the
same as for the architectural review ... but because you have already
followed this process (for your architectural reviews) these
reviews will not be observed and graded.  But you are still 
responsible for producing a report for each review, and these reports
will be graded.   Each team member will lead one design review, and
act as scribe for one design review.
<P>
As with the architectural review,
this is not "meeting minutes".  Rather it is a distillation of key issues and
decisions.  It should be carefully written and reviewed.  It must contain:
<UL>
   <LI> the time, date, and attendees
   <LI> the component to be reviewed
   <LI> a clear summary of each important issue rased
   <LI> a characterization as a defect, question, or issue
   <LI> a characterization as must-fix, should-fix, or comment
   <LI> a disposition for the entire proposal of

	<li> requires another meeting
	<li> rejected (this cannot be made to work)

It is likely that your design review will turn up issues that require
changes to your specifications, design and test plan.  Address those
issues (by revising your specifications, design and test plan), document 
the changes that were made to address each, and get agreement from the 
reviewers that the issues have been satisfactorally addressed.

<H3>2.8 Post-Mortem Report</H3>
</a>
This project is a learning exercise, and one of the major ways
we learn is by analyzing past mistakes.  You will, as a team,
review all aspects of this project.  One of you will then 
summarize that process into a post-mortem analysis report.
<P>
<H4>2.8.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
A report, summarizing the key issues raised in your post-mortem,
and the conclusions you came to.  Your post-mortem discussion 
should include:
<ul>
	<li> architectural refinement and specification development.
	<li> development of the component designs.
	<li> development of the test plans.
	<li> the review process and the resulting design/plan changes.
	<li> the planning and ongoing management of these activities.
	<li> the overall project as an educational exercise.
</ul>
<P>
Note that if you make no mistakes, you will not be able to earn any points
on the post-mortem.  Fortunately, no teams have ever found it necessary
to deliberately make mistakes in order to have something to analyze.

<a name="grade_pm">
<H4>2.8.2 Grading</h4>
</a>
This report be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 50% whether or not you meaningfully discuss each of the required activities.
	<li> 20% whether or not you identify all of the important incidents.
	<li> 30% the extent to which you are able to derive and articulate useful lessons
	     (and good future advice) from those experiences.
</ul>

<H4>2.9 Management</h4>
<a name="desc_mgt"></a>
<P>
<a name="grade_mgt">
The team will be graded on how effectively they managed themselves
and the work: 
</a>
<OL type=a>
    <LI> Perform the work according to the plan.<br>
	 We will determine when work was done by looking
	 at the dates of the final check-ins.
    <LI> Monitor progress and detect problems.<br>
	 Monitoring plans should be included in your
	 project plan.  Status should be reviewed regularly,
	 and logged as updates to the project plan.
	 Problems that come up should be recorded as updates 
	 to the project plan and discussed in your post-mortem.
    <LI> Reasonably adjust the plan in response to problems.<br>
	 Detected problems and responses should be 
	 reflected in revisions to the plan, and discussed
	 in your post-mortem.
</OL>

<H3>3.1 Due Dates and Slip Days</H3>
</a>
<P>
Any assignment that is not turned in by its <strong>due date</strong>,
will have its grade reduced by 10% (of its nominal value) for each
late day.  I understand that problems happen, and so each student is
granted three <em>slip days</em>.  A team of four students would have
twelve slip days between them.
<P>
One slip-day will excuse <strong>one</strong> deliverable 
being late by <strong>one</strong> day.   
If a design is one day late, and that delays the
design review by a day, then you may find that you need two slip-days.  
Don't make the mistake of using up your slip-days too soon, because
the pressures generally get tighter later in the course. 
<P>
When a team needs to use slip-days, they need to decide who's
days they are using.  However you decide is OK with me, but
we will be tracking the slip days per student.
If will be using any slip days on a deliverable, tell me in 
advance that you will be doing so (so that I don't nag you
about whether or not I lost your submission message).

<h3>3.2 Collaboration and Citation</a></h3>
<p>
This is a team project, but different individuals will have primary
responsibility for different processes or work products (or different 
parts of a single work product or process).  Each team will be working 
on a different type of product.  You are free to talk your team members 
(and for that matter other teams) about the processes you are following.
You may review your work products with your own team members, and revise
them based on their feedback ... but ...
</a></p><ol type="1">
<a name="5_rules">   </a><li><a name="5_rules">	If you are the primary author of a work-product, you must
	cite the source of text you did not write (if it is more
	than a sentence), or any information that did not originate
	within your team or from your interviews.
	</a><p>
<a name="5_rules">	You will be doing research to develop your product definition and
	requirements.  I expect that many of the ideas for your product
	will come from this research.  Cite all of your sources for each
	work product, and explain how each source contributed to your work
	products.

     for reviews) with members of other teams.
