It is intended that, for most rubric items,  you be able to simply assign:
	+	well done
	OK	satisfactory
	-	weak
	X	unsatisfactory

    If you give a minus or X to anything, explain why in the comment
    lines beneath that rubric item.


Assign points (based on the marks) in each section:

	if all marks OK or better, the section earns full points

	minus marks are probably worth half-points, but plus marks compensate for minuses
	
	an X for any item in the section probably means zero points for that section


Absent something exceptional, the overall assignment score should simply be the 
sum of the points in the individual sections.
