    Component Design		___/20

	completeness		___/2

		___	defined methods and instance variables seem sufficent to fully
			implement the component's interface and functional specifications

	externals 		___/5

			initialize, AND UPDATE THEM CORRECTLY (2pt)


	internal methods/data	___/3	(if none needed, use the external scores)

		___	it is clear why each exists, and they seem reasonably defined
