   Primary authorships:

   Preliminary Architecture:		___/20

	overview:		___/5

		___	a high level summary of what it will do and how it will do it


		___	an enumeration of the key S/W components (not the U/I)


		___	a description of their roles and interactions (not U/I)


		___	diagrams of component relationships and/or operational context (not U/I)


		___	diagrams illustrating inter-component and external interfaces (not U/I)


	specifications:		___/3

		___	functionality of each software module is described
			(what the software does, not what the screens look like)


		___	key interfaces to each component are described (at least in general terms)
			(full credit: type of interface, included operations/methods)


		___	key/persistent data is adequately described
			(full credit: general description of contents and form)


		___	key requirements for each component are described
			(full credit: explicit functional requirements)



	rationale:		___/2

		___	discussion of key concerns that drove the architecture
			(full credit: all major non-obvious decisons are covered)


		___	reasonable justification for each non-obvious decision
			(no points if none presented)



	issues:			___/2


		___	covers ALL obvious what/how concerns


		___	reasonable/adequate analysis and research (for each issue)


		___	a reasonable plan for addressing each issue (for each issue)



	prototyping/research:	___/2

		___	reasonable decisions about what required prototyping
			(all significant risks, including new tools, were investigated)

		___	reasonable investigations (clear goals, adequate, but not too much)


		___	well conducted investigations (question has been well answered)


		___	clear results presented
			(these risks are under control)


	analysis/feasibility:	___/2

		___	covers all non-trivial components
			(all of the code that must be written)


		___	reasonable approach/technology to implement each component

		
		___	reasonable uses of off-the-shelf tools and components
			(with adequate investigation of adequacy and usability)


		___	clear results presented
			(complete and compelling)


	overall impressions:	___/4

		___	clarity: I understand what they propose to build


		___	depth and detail: what each component will do, how it will work


		___	reasonableness: solution seems appropriate, robust, not overly complex


		___	completeness (pieces add up to a reasonable whole, w/no significant holes)


		___	consistency: all the stories agree


		___	viability: I believe this could be implemented and would work
