<A name="submission">
<H4>Submissions</H4>
</a>
<P>
Project deliverables should be submitted by up-loading files to the appropriate Canvas Assignment.
Note that several project phases have multiple deliverables (e.g. presentation, meeting notes, and analysis),
<u>each of which</u> must be submitted (as a distinct assignment).
<br>
Team deliverables need only be submitted by one (any) team member.
Personal deliverables (e.g. notes you prepared before a design review, or code you have implemented)
must be submitted (individually) by <u>each</u> team member.
</p>
<p>
Each up-loaded deliverable should begin with a standard submission prologue describing:
<ul>
   <li>a list of the people who should receive credit for this deliverable</li>
   <li>the primary author (perhaps broken down by section) who's work this represents</li>
   <li>a (Github or Google) URL where we can find the history of this (and related) deliverables</li>
   <li>if this submission is late, how many late days from whom should be used</li>
</ul>
A typical example might be:
<PRE>
    Team: Kallisti

    Members: Andromeda, Algernon, Medea, Zebulon

    Project: 1D - Final Proposal
       Product proposal:  https:/github.com/kallisti/proposal.txt
       primary author: Algernon

    Slip Days: 1 (Zebulon)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Where practical, the preferred submission format is ASCII text
(the most common format for source code, universally readable on almost any computer), but ...
<ul>
   <li> if you need to include diagrams or have other highly structured information 
        to present, other relatively universal formats (e.g. <tt>pdf</tt> or <tt>html</tt>)
	can be used.</li>
   <li> Richer deliverables can also be maintained as a
   	<A href="http://google.com/docs/about">Google Doc</A>,
   	<A href="http://google.com/sheets/about">Google Sheet</A>,
   	or <A href="http://google.com/slides/about">Google SLides</A> presentation
	(any of which can be viewed by any browser).</li>
   <li> do not submit files in any format (e.g. <tt>Word</tt>, <tt>RTF</tt>, 
        <tt>Excel</tt>, or <tt>PowerPoint</tt>) that requires additional processing
	(with potentially proprietary software) in order to make it readable.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
A short and simple ASCII text submission (e.g. review notes or a post-mortem)
can be submitted in the same file, immediately after the submission prologue.  
<BR>
For a richer (e.g. <tt>pdf</tt> submission, the submission prologue can simply
be included at the start of the document.
<BR>
For larger documents, maintained on Github or in Google Docs
(and can therefore be accessed via the web), simply include the
Github or Google URLs in the submission prologue.
If you do this, please ensure that the repo is public or the Google docs
are readable by anyone with the URL.
</P>

<H4>Due Dates and Slip Days</H4>
</a>
<P>
Any assignment that is not turned in by midnight at the end of its <strong>due date</strong>,
will have its grade reduced by 10% (of its nominal value) for each
late day.  I understand that problems happen, and so each student is
granted a few (SLIP_DAYS) <em>slip days</em>.  A team of four students would have
(between them) four times that number of <em>slip days</em>.
</P>
<P>
One slip-day will excuse <strong>a single day's deliverables</strong>
being late by <strong>up to twenty-four hours</strong>.
<ul>
   <li> for team deliverables, a single slip day is all that is required.
	If you are using a slip day for a team deliverable, please state
	(in the submission) who's slip day is being used.
        </li>
   <li> for individual deliverables, each person who is making a late
        delivery must use a slip day.</li>
   <li> when ever a slip day is to be used, this must be stated in
        the submission header, so that we know to deduct a slip day
	rather than deducting points from your score.
	</li>
</ul>
But, be careful about using slip-days:
<ul>
   <li> a slip-day will buy you one extra day to work on a particular
        deliverable (e.g. a module design), but spending an extra day
	on that means you have one fewer day to work on the next
	week's deliverable(s).</li>
   <li> slip days are probably more valuable later in the semester,
        as the project work demands more time, as term projects come
	due in other classes, and when most of the deliverables are
	individual.  Don't make the mistake of using half of your
	slip days on projects one and two.
   </li>
</ul>
<P>
If you plan on using slip days on a deliverable, please tell me
(or your grutor) that you will be doing so (so that we don't nag you
about whether or not we lost your submission).
</P>

<a name="individual">
<H4>Team and Individual Grades</H4>
</a>
<P>
When we tackle big projects, we succeed or fail as a team.
Consequently, the majority of the grade you earn on a team 
project will be based on the overall quality of the team's 
product.   But a team can only be successful if everybody
is working towards producing quality results.
Thus, a non-negligible portion of your grade
will be based on your individual contributions:
</P>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
	<th>criterion</th> <th>value</th>
</tr>
<tr>	<td>quality of <a href=#primary_author>primary authorships</a></td>	<td>10%</td> </tr>
<tr>	<td><a href=#work_share>share of project work</a></td>	<td>5%</td> </tr>
<tr>	<td>personal on-time performance</td>	<td>5%</td> </tr>
</TABLE>

<a name="primary_author">
<H4>Primary Authorship</h4>
</A>
<P>
While many activities (e.g. Post Mortem review) are fundamentally team
activities, each major work product will typically have a primary author:
one person who works up the basic organization, pulls together the contributions
from the other team members, and writes most of the prose.
</P>
<P>
The ability to organize large collections of complex information into a coherent
narrative is a fundamental skill for any engineer or researcher.
Each team member should take primary
authorship for multiple work products.  The quality portion of the individual
contribution grade will be based on the work products for which that person was
the primary author (presided over a process, or wrote at least 2/3 of
the text in a document).
</P>
<P>
Each work product submission must include (in its prologue) 
an indication of the primary author.  If (e.g. in a larger document)
different sections had different primary authors, include this
information in the submission prologue.  Primary authorships are 
important for two reasons:
<ol type="1">
    <li> For a team to handle a complex project, it is usually 
         necessary for a single member to take primary responsibility
	 for each deliverable.  I want to see that you can do this.</li>
    <li> Even though the whole team will review (and perhaps revise)
         each major deliverable, most of its quality (depth, clarity,
	 cogency) comes from the original draft.  I want to see how
	 well each of you can tell an important technical story.</li>
</ol>
</P>
<H4>Team Review of All Deliverables</h4>
<P>
Since the whole team will be graded
on the quality of most work products, it is only prudent
for the entire team to review any high-value work product 
before it is submitted.  The description of every deliverable
for every project includes:
<ul>
   <li> a list of the things it must include </li>
   <li> a list of how many points will be awarded for which contents </li>
</ul>
If you, as a team, review each deliverable (whether team or individual)
against those criteria, you should expect to find that both the reviewers
and reviewees reap significant benefits:
<ol type="a">
   <li> In reviewing someone else's submission, we have the opportunity
        to observe and learn from things they have done well.</li>
   <li> In analyzing the completeness and cogency of someone else's submission, we
        will gain a deeper understanding of what makes a good presentation.</li>
   <li> We all suffer from <em>confirmation bias</em>, which makes it
        difficult for us to see things that we have missed.  Getting
	critical review and feedback from others before submitting our final 
	version will greatly improve both our submissions and scores.</li>
</ol>
This is not merely a trick that students can use to improve their learning
and grades in this class.  We all depend on our friends and co-workers to help 
us do our best (or the right thing) on anything that matters.
</P>

<a name="work_share">
<H4>Share of Project Work</h4>
</a>
<P>
The quantification of individual contributions is an inexact process.
The most obvious unit of contribution might be hours worked, tho
reported hours often seem poorly correlated to results obtained.
None the less, team members generally have a pretty good sense of who 
is working how hard and contributing how much value.
At the end of each project, each member of each team should (privately)
submit their own assessment of how the overall effort/contributions
were divided between the various project activities and team members.
Ideally this might be csv export from a spreadsheet like:
</P>
<table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" frame="border">
<tr>	<th>activity</th>	<th>% tot</th>	<th>Balder</th>	<th>Osirus</th>	<th>Algernon</th>	</tr>
<tr>	<td>management</td>	<td>15%</td>	<td>50%</td>	<td>30%</td>	<td>20%</td>		</tr>
<tr>	<td>research</td>	<td>25%</td>	<td></td>	<td>75%</td>	<td>25%</td>		</tr>
<tr>	<td>report #1</td>	<td>10%</td>	<td>10%</td>	<td>75%</td>	<td>15%</td>		</tr>
<tr>	<td>prototyping</td>	<td>35%</td>	<td>25%</td>	<td>15%</td>	<td>65%</td>		</tr>
<tr>	<td>final report</td>	<td>15%</td>	<td>50%</td>	<td>25%</td>	<td>25%</td>		</tr>
<tr>	<td></td>		<td></td>	<td><hr /></td>	<td><hr /></td>	<td><hr /></td>		</tr>
<tr>	<td></td>		<td></td>	<td>22%</td>	<td>37%</td>	<td>35%</td>		</tr>
</table>
<center>
(where the bottom row is a <tt>sumproduct</tt> of the second column and the per-person columns)
</center>
<P>
These submissions will be kept confidential, and averaged together to get a sense 
of the individual contributions to each team's efforts.
</P>

<a name="management">
<H4>Management Grading</h4>
</a>
<P>
The team will be graded on how effectively they managed themselves
and the work.
<OL type=a>
    <LI> Perform the work according to the plan.<br>
	 We will determine when a deliverable was completed by
	 looking at the names and dates for the commits.</li>
    <LI> Monitor progress and detect problems.<br>
	 Monitoring plans should be included in your
	 project plan.  Status should be reviewed regularly
	 (e.g. daily) with minutes promptly checked in to github.
    <LI> Reasonably adjust the plan in response to problems.<br>
	 Detected problems and responses should be discussed
	 in your post-mortem, and reflected in revisions to
	 the plan.</li>
</OL>
</P>
<P>
In assigning the management grades we will review the commit history
(or Google Docs history) for your meeting minutes and work plan.
<br>
Please include the URLs (e.g. GitHub or Google Docs) for these files in 
the final submission prologue for each post-mortem you submit.
</p>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr> <th>criterion</th>							<th>value</th>	</tr>
<tr> <td>regular status checks (as verified by checked-in minutes)</td>	<td>40%</td>	</tr>
<tr> <td>plan (approach, assignments, schedule) kept up-to-date</td>	<td>20%</td>	</tr>
<tr> <td>problems promptly and reasonably addressed,
         work performed according to (updated) plan</td>		<td>40%</td>	</tr>
</TABLE>

<a name="postmortem">
<H4>Post-Mortem Analyses</H4>
</a>
Each project is a learning exercise, and one of the major ways
we learn is by analyzing past mistakes.  You will, as a team,
review all aspects of each project.  One of you will then 
summarize that discussion into a post-mortem analysis report.
</P>
<P>
Like all good post-morti, this should be a safe activity ... where there
are no penalties discussing mistakes.
Your grade for all post mortem reports is not based on how
well you did in following the project processes, but what
you learned.
More specifically, the grade will be based on:
<ul>
	<li> 50% the extent to which you meaningfully discuss each of the required 
	     activities (e.g. there should be some mention of the processes that
	     led to ther creation of each deliverable).</li>
	<li> 20% your identification and examination of the important incidents.</li>
	<li> 30% the extent to which you are able to derive and articulate useful lessons
	     (and good future advice) from those experiences.</li>
</ul>
Note that if you make no mistakes or learned no lessons, you will not be able 
earn the points for identifying and discussing them.
Fortunately, no teams have ever yet found it necessary
to deliberately make mistakes in order to have something to analyze. :-)
</P>
<P>
When your Post-Mortem Anslysis is ready for submission, prefix
it with a standard submission prologue that includes 
the primary author and GitHub URLs for:
<ul>
   <li>the Post-Mortem Analysis</li>
   <li>your (up-to-date) plan</li>
   <li>your status meeting minutes</li>
</ul>
</P>

<a name="citation">
<h4>Collaboration and Citation</h4>
</a>
<p>
This is a team project, but different individuals will have primary
responsibility for different processes or work products (or different 
parts of a single work product or process).  Each team will be working 
on a different type of product.  You are free to talk your team members 
(and for that matter other teams) about the processes you are following.
You may review your work products with your own team members, and revise
them based on their feedback ... but ...
</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>If you are the primary author of a work-product, you must
	cite the source of text you did not write (if it is more
	than a sentence), or any information that did not originate
	within your team or from your interviews.</li>
    <li>You will be doing research to develop your product definition and
	requirements.  I expect that many of the ideas for your product
	will come from this research.  Cite all of your sources for each
	work product, and explain how each source contributed to your work
	products.</li>
    <li>You may not share any of your work products (other than as required
     for reviews) with members of other teams.</li>
</ol>
