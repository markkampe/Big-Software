<H2>1. Introduction</h2>
</a>

Now that you have a well formulated idea of what your product should do, it
is time to figure out how such a product can be built.  This design must
be elaborated and described well enough that outside reviewers can 
evaluate it, assess its feasibility, and identify holes in your design.
This project will exercise a great many key design skills:
<P>
<UL>
   <LI> coming up with a viable high level architecture
   <LI> working out the details to validate that architecture
   <LI> describing that architecture well enough that others can understand it
   <LI> reviewing someone else's design, understanding the issues, and
        articulating them in a useful form
   <LI> working the issues that are inevitably discovered to yield
	an architecture that actually has a chance of working.
</UL>

<A name="desc">
<H2>2. Major Activities and Deliverables</h2>
</a>

<P>
There are several major parts to this project, each of which has its
own goals, processes, and deliverables:
<ol type=1>
	
	<li><b>Initial Plan</b><br> 
		You will develop a plan for this project, dividing the
		work over your team members and the available time.  
	<li><b>Preliminary Architecture</b><br> 
		You will develop an architecture and high level component 
		specifications for your project (probably going through 
		many internal revisions and reviews before you have a
		design that works).
		Once you believe that you have a viable architecture, you
		will document it, and submit it for design review by another
		team.
	<li><b>Review</b><br>
		You will study another team's proposal, conduct
		a formal design review, write up a detailed report,
		and work the raised issues with the creating team.
	<li><b>Revised Architectural Proposal</b><br>
		You will revise your architectural proposal to
		address the issues raised in your design review
		and prepare a final proposal.
	<li><b>Post Mortem</b> <br>
		You will review the processes you followed in this project
		to see what lessons you can learn for how to do things more
		effectively in the future.
	<li><b>Project Management </b><br> 
		All of the above will be planned, documented, and managed.
</ol>

<a name="desc_1">
<H3>2.1 Plan</h3>
</a>
The development of the architecture may probably be much more difficult
than you imagine, the process of describing it clearly in writing
may prove extremely challenging, and you will probably discover that
(after your design review) you have a great deal of non-trivial work
to do to fix your design.  Also, remember that design is a <em>wicked</em> 
problem:
<UL>
   <LI> You may not know how many components you 
	have to specify and analyze until your
	architecture is largely complete.
   <LI>	You may not have any sense of how difficult
	the component analyses will be or how many
	iterations you will have to make over the 
	architecture until you have gone through a
	few rounds of revisions and can judge the
	difficulty of the issue and rate of convergence.
   <LI>	You may not have any sense of how the number
	or difficulty of the issues that will be raised
	in the design review until after it has been
	completed.
</UL>
Each of these factors can cause the work to very quickly
grow much larger than your initial estimates.  This means
you need to get budget a great deal of time for revision
and rework, and get started as soon and fast as possible.

<H4>2.1.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>

Each team will prepare a task-breakdown, identify the dependency relationships between
tasks, and owners for each sub-task, assign due-dates, and schedule regular reviews
of both work-products and progress (to enable adequate time to deal with the
problems that <strong>will</strong> happen).  
A good management plan will include regular status
checks, the results of which should be recorded in the plan document.
<P>
As your understanding of the problem
evolves and you respond to unanticipated events, 
you will have to revise your plan (not merely estimates, but
the work to be done).
If deadlines are missed, or deliverables fail to pass review, the fact, as well
as the causes and the plan to remedy them must be documented.
<P>

<a name="grade_1">
<H4>2.1.2 Grading</h4>
</a>

Your initial Management Plan will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 40% good use of time and resources (work apportioned reasonably over the available time)
	<li> 20% specificity of plan (clear responsibilities: who, what, when)
	<li> 20% provisions for early detection of problems, and time to deal with them
	<li> 20% completeness
</ul>

<a name="sub_1">
<H4>2.1.3 Submission</h4>
</a>

Maintain your plan on github. 
You will surely be updating it, and we will be reviewing your history
(changes and comments).
When you are ready to submit them for grading, fill
out the following form and e-mail it to the submission alias.

<H3>2.2 Preliminary Architecture</h3>
</a>
You will design and specify a set of components that is (in combination)
capable of delivering your version 1.0 product functionality.  
It is tempting to draw some high level pictures and a brief
set of descriptions and call it an architecture ...
but the <em>devil is in the details</em>.
The hard part is working out the implementation and
characteristics of the architecture
in sufficient detail to demonstrate that
the described system is buildable and likely to work:
<UL>
   <LI>	the described assembly of components is capable
	of delivering the required functionality.
   <LI> each of the described components is 
	reasonably implementable.
   <LI> the described interfaces are reasonably abstracted
	(understandable and convenient) from the clients' 
	perspective.
   <LI>	the described interfaces are reasonably abstracted
	(clear, implementable, with good information hiding)
	from the component's perspective.
   <LI>	the development work is supported by mature and usable tools
	and technology.
</UL>
<P>
Recall that McConnell described design as a
<em>wicked</em> problem, in that you may not even have a list of
problems to be solved until you have designed (and discarded)
a few solutions.  This is a highly iterative process, and these
iterations may consume a great deal of your time.
Often, the best way to convince ourselves of the feasibility
of an architecture
is to sketch out possible implementations of each major 
component, looking for options and issues.   Such preliminary
research, design, analysis, and prototyping is an important
sanity check on the viability of the proposed architecture.
The goal of these investigations is not to fully design the
major components, but merely to present a compelling argument 
for the "feasibility" of the proposed component descriptions:
<UL>
   <LI>	Where stable off the shelf technology is available, this may
	require no more work than confirming that the the available
	technology supports the required interfaces and functionality.

   <LI> Where newer technology is available, it may be appropriate
	to do a little more research (and/or prototyping) to 
	confirm its usability and suitability for the proposed
	problem.

   <LI>	Where new components must be constructed, it may still
	be possible to use much off-the-shelf technology ... in
	which case the design may be little more than showing how
	existing components can be combined to achieve the required
	functionality.

   <LI>	For new components that must be constructed from scratch,
	it is common to construct a high level design ... with just
	enough detail to convince ourselves that such a component
	is buildable, and unlikely to involve any "hard" problems.
</UL>
You don't want your architecture to turn into a complete top-down
design for the whole system.  A component analysis only needs to be
complete enough to convince the reviewers that the most of the 
likely problems have been identified, and are all likely to be solveable.
Every major component should be analyzed to this "feasibility" level.
Each member of the team should take ownership of the analysis
for at least one major architectural component.  If you have many
more components than people, each person should choose at least 
one <em>interesting</em> component for thorough analysis, and you
can do a less complete job on the simpler components.
In the unlikely situation that you have more people than 
interesting components, 
sub-divide your major components to create more pieces or find a
problem that requires further analysis or prototyping.

<H4>2.2.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
Your architectural description should include:
<UL>
   <LI> A high-level prose description of how the required functionality 
	will be delivered.
   <LI> High-level prose descriptions of each of the run-time components:
	what it does, and the requirements it must meet.
   <LI> High-level prose descriptions of the major persistent data objects:
	what kind of information they contain, how/where they are stored,
	and (where appropriate) supporting middle-ware (e.g. MySQL).
   <LI>	diagrams illustrating the components, their instantiation/deployment
	in a real system, and their interactions.
   <LI>	characterizations of the external interfaces, and the interfaces
	between the major components.
   <LI> Discussions of the key issues that arose in the development of
	this architecture and the rationale that drove the selection of
	the chosen approach.  
   <LI> Discussions of major issues (anything that causes you to doubt
	that it will be possible to successfully build this system on a
	predictable schedule): what the problem is, what options have been
	considered, and how those options fall short.
</UL>
This should be backed up by a set of component analyses (research,
designs, analyses, prototypes, etc) that were done to establish 
the feasibility of implementing each major component:
<UL>
   <LI> where existing technology is being used, provide references
	and summarize the investigation you did to determine its
	suitability.
   <LI>	where analysis was done, provide a write-up of the issues
	investigated, the means of the investigation, and results.
   <LI> where prototyping was done, describe the risk issues to
	be addressed, a summary of the approach and results, 
	and github URLs for the actual prototypes constructed.
   <LI>	where new design work was done, provide design documentation
	similar to (but hopefully much simpler than) that described
	for the architectural description.
</UL>
<P>
You will note that, while I do describe what should be present in your
architectural description (and there are two full lectures on the
elements of good architecture), I am not giving you sample architectural
descriptions.  
There are two reasons for this:
<UL>
   <LI>	Every system is unique in both structure and constraints, and
	its story probably requires a unique telling.  Giving you 
	samples that did not fit the needs of your particular project
	would probably do more harm than good ... as you tried to force
	my square peg into your round hole.
   <LI>	Among the (difficult and soft) skills that I want you to develop 
	are learning to visualize complex systems, and express those 
	visions technical prose.  I expect that figuring out how to best 
	tell your story will prove to be a highly educational exercise.

<H3>2.3 Design Review</h3>
</a>

As we refine a design, it is easy to become convinced that we have
made the right decision and that our design is therefore correct.
After we have done our best at refining our architecture, it is time
to seek independent validation from people who haven't already bought-in
to our solution.
<P>
Each team will read over another team's architectural presentation,
prepare detailed notes, conduct a formal design review, produce a
written report, and work with the designing team to ensure reasonable
resolution of all outstanding issues.

<H4>2.3.1 Deliverables</h4>

<H3>2.8 Post-Mortem Report</H3>
</a>
This project is a learning exercise, and one of the major ways
we learn is by analyzing past mistakes.  You will, as a team,
review all aspects of this project.  One of you will then 
summarize that process into a post-mortem analysis report.
<P>
<H4>2.8.1 Deliverables</h4>
<P>
A report, summarizing the key issues raised in your post-mortem,
and the conclusions you came to.  Your post-mortem discussion 
should include:
<ul>
	<li> creation of the initial architecture
	<li> initial refinement of the architecture
	<li> component design analyses
	<li> creating draft architectural description
	<li> studying for your design review
	<li> the design review meeting (as a reviewer)
	<li> the design review meeting (as a reviewee)
	<li> writing up the review report and working the issues
	<li> revising your architecture to address the issues
	<li> the planning and ongoing management of these activities
	<li> the overall project as an educational exercise

<H4>2.9 Management</h4>
<a name="desc_mgt"></a>
<P>
<a name="grade_mgt">
The team will be graded on how effectively they managed themselves
and the work: 
</a>
<OL type=a>
    <LI> Perform the work according to the plan.<br>
	 We will determine when work was done by looking
	 at the dates of the final check-ins.
    <LI> Monitor progress and detect problems.<br>
	 Monitoring plans should be included in your
	 project plan.  Status should be reviewed regularly,
	 and logged as updates to the project plan.
	 Problems that come up should be recorded as updates 
	 to the project plan and discussed in your post-mortem.
    <LI> Reasonably adjust the plan in response to problems.<br>
	 Detected problems and responses should be discussed
	 in your post-mortem, and reflected in revisions to
	 the plan.
</OL>

<H3>3.1 Due Dates and Slip Days</H3>
</a>
<P>
Any assignment that is not turned in by its <strong>due date</strong>,
will have its grade reduced by 10% (of its nominal value) for each
late day.  I understand that problems happen, and so each student is
granted three <em>slip days</em>.  A team of four students would have
twelve slip days between them.
<P>
One slip-day will excuse <strong>one</strong> deliverable 
being late by <strong>one</strong> day.   
If a design is one day late, and that delays the
design review by a day, then you may find that you need two slip-days.  
Don't make the mistake of using up your slip-days too soon, because
the pressures generally get tighter later in the course. 
<P>
When a team needs to use slip-days, they need to decide who's
days they are using.  However you decide is OK with me, but
we will be tracking the slip days per student.
If will be using any slip days on a deliverable, tell me in 
advance that you will be doing so (so that I don't nag you
about whether or not I lost your submission message).

<H3>3.2 Team and Individual Grades</H3>
</a>
<P>
When we tackle big projects, we succeed or fail as a team.
Consequently, the majority of the grade you earn on a team 
project will be based on the overall quality of the team's 
product.   But a team can only be successful if everybody
is working towards producing quality results.
Thus, a non-negligible portion of your grade
will be based on individual contributions:

<a name="breakdown"></A>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
	<th>criterion</th> <th>value</th>
</tr>
<tr>	<td>quality of <a href=#primary>primary authorships</a></td>	<td>5%</td> </tr>
<tr>	<td><a href=#share>share of project work</a></td>	<td>5%</td> </tr>
<tr>	<td>personal on-time performance</td>	<td>5%</td> </tr>
</TABLE>

<A name="primary">
<H3>3.3 Primary Authorship</h3>
</A>
While many activities (e.g. Post Mortem review) are fundamentally team
activities, each major work product will typically have a primary author:
one person who works up the basic organization, pulls together the contribution
from the other team members and writes most of the prose.
<P>
The ability to organize large collections of information into a coherent
narrative is an important skill, and each team members should take primary
authorship for multiple work products.  The quality portion of the individual
contribution grade is based on the work products for which that person was
the primary author (presided over a process, or wrote at least 2/3 of
the text in a document).
<P>
Each work product submission must include an indication of the
primary author (or authors if no individual produced 2/3 of the text).
Note, however, that since the whole team will be graded
on the quality of each work product, it is only prudent
for the entire team to review any high-value work product 
before it is submitted.

<A name="share">
<H3>3.4 Share of Project Work</H3>
</A>
The quantification of individual contributions is an inexact process.
Reports of hours-spent are sometimes unreliable, and often seem 
poorly correlated to results obtained.  None the less, team members
generally have a pretty good sense of who is working how hard and
contributing how much value.
At the end of each project, each member of each team should submit
(by private e-mail to me) an assessment of how the overall effort
was divided between the various project activities and team members.
Something like:
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
	<tr> <th>activity</th> 		<th>fraction of total</th>	<th>Algernon</th> <th>Balder</th> <th>Osiris</th> </tr>
        <tr> <th>management</th>	<td>15%</td>	<td>50%</td>	<td>30%</td>	<td>20%</td>	</tr>
        <tr> <th>research</th>		<td>25%</td>	<td>00%</td>	<td>75%</td>	<td>25%</td>	</tr>
        <tr> <th>report 1</th>		<td>10%</td>	<td>10%</td>	<td>75%</td>	<td>15%</td>	</tr>
        <tr> <th>prototyping</th>	<td>35%</td>	<td>20%</td>	<td>15%</td>	<td>65%</td>	</tr>
        <tr> <th>final report</th>	<td>15%</td>	<td>50%</td>	<td>25%</td>	<td>25%</td>	</tr>
</TABLE>
<P>
I will keep these as confidential, and average them together to get a sense
of the individual contributions to each team's efforts.
<P>
<h3>3.5 Collaboration and Citation</a></h3>
<p>
This is a team project, but different individuals will have primary
responsibility for different processes or work products (or different 
parts of a single work product or process).  Each team will be working 
on a different type of product.  You are free to talk your team members 
(and for that matter other teams) about the processes you are following.
You may review your work products with your own team members, and revise
them based on their feedback ... but ...
</a></p><ol type="1">
<a name="5_rules">   </a><li><a name="5_rules">	If you are the primary author of a work-product, you must
	cite the source of text you did not write (if it is more
	than a sentence), or any information that did not originate
	within your team or from your interviews.
	</a><p>
<a name="5_rules">	You will be doing research to develop your product definition and
	requirements.  I expect that many of the ideas for your product
	will come from this research.  Cite all of your sources for each

	products.
