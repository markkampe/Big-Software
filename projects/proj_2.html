</a>
Architecture and Review
</h1>
</center>
<h2> Introduction</h2>
<P>
If something is simple, a well-trained person can just sit-down and do it.
But real-world problems often defy simple solutions, 
and complex systems tend to be confronted by non-obvious challenges,
and to exhibit unanticipated behaviors.  We would like to
simply sit down, start writing the parts that are obvious, and trust that
the rest will become clear to us as we move down that path.   That story
has been told countless many times, and it almost always ends in tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Now that you have a well formulated idea of what your product should do, it
is time to figure out <u>how such a product can be built</u>.
This design must be elaborated and described well enough that outside reviewers can 
evaluate it, assess its feasibility, and identify holes in your design.
This project will exercise a great many key design skills:
</P>
<UL>
   <LI> coming up with a viable high level architecture</li>
   <LI> working out the implications of your architecture to component definitions</li>
   <LI> identifying questions and risks best addressed through research and/or prototypes</li>
   <LI> validate your architecture against your requirements (and general goodness properties)</li>
   <LI> describing that architecture well enough that others can understand it</li>
   <LI> reviewing someone else's design, understanding the issues, and
        articulating them in a useful form</li>
   <LI> working the issues that are inevitably discovered to yield
	an architecture that actually has a chance of working.</li>
</UL>
All of the above skills are fundamental to any significant software development effort.
<P>
There are multiple parts to this project, each of which has its
own goals, processes, and deliverables:

<H3>P2A.1 Plan</h3>
</a>
<P>
The development of the architecture may prove much more difficult
than you imagine, the process of describing it clearly in writing
may prove extremely challenging, and you will probably discover that
(after your design review) you have some non-trivial work
to do to fix your design.  Also, remember that design is a <em>wicked</em> 
problem:
<UL>
   <LI> The architecture evolves with your evolving
   	understanding of the problem.
   	You may not be sure how many components you 
	have to specify and analyze until your
	architecture is largely complete.</li>
   <LI>	You may not have any sense of how difficult
	the component analyses will be, or how many
	iterations you will have to make over the 
	architecture until you have gone through a
	few rounds of revisions, and can judge the
	difficulty of the issues and rate of convergence.</li>
   <LI>	You may not have any sense of the number
	or difficulty of the issues that will be raised
	in the design review until after it has been
	completed.  (If you had recognized those issues
	you would have dealt with them before the review)</li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
Each of these factors can cause the work to very quickly
grow much larger than your initial estimates. 
Many students consider the development and description of the
preliminary architecture to be the most difficult part of the entire course.
<u>This means you need to get started as soon and fast as possible,
and budget a great deal of time for revision and rework.</u>
</P>
<P>
Each team will prepare a task-breakdown, identify the dependency relationships between
tasks, and owners for each sub-task, assign due-dates, and schedule regular reviews
of both work-products and progress (to enable adequate time to deal with the
<u>problems that will arise</u>).  
A good management plan will include regular (e.g. daily) status checks, whose
results should be recorded in a <tt>minutes.txt</tt> file in your repo.
</P>
<P>
As your understanding of the problem
evolves and you respond to unanticipated events, 
you will have to revise your plan (not merely estimates, but
the work to be done).
If deadlines are missed, or deliverables fail to pass review, the fact, as well
as the causes and the plan to remedy them must be documented.
</P>
<P>
Your initial Management Plan will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 40% good use of time and resources (work apportioned reasonably over the available time)</li>
	<li> 20% specificity of plan (clear responsibilities: who, what, when)</li>
	<li> 20% provisions for early detection of problems, and time to deal with them</li>
	<li> 20% completeness</li>
</ul>
<P>
Maintain your plan (and status update minutes) on github.
You will probably be updating them daily,
and we will be reviewing this history.
</P>
<P>
When you are ready to submit your plan for grading:
<ul>
    <li> prepare your management plan (ideally ASCII text in a file named <tt>management_2a.txt</tt>)</li>
    <li> put a <a href="#submission">standard submission prologue</a> on the front of each file</li>
    <li> up-load it to your Sakai Dropbox (only one person on the team needs to do this)</li>
</ul>
</P>

<H3>P2A.2 Preliminary Architecture</h3>
</a>
<P>
You will design and specify a set of components that is (in combination)
capable of delivering your version 1.0 product functionality.  
It is tempting to draw some high level pictures and a brief
set of descriptions and call it an architecture ...
but the <em>devil is in the details</em>.
The hard part is working out the implementation and
characteristics of the architecture
in sufficient detail to demonstrate that
the described system is buildable and likely to work:
</p>
<UL>
   <LI>	the described assembly of components is capable
	of delivering the required functionality.</li>
   <LI> each of the described components is 
	reasonably implementable.</li>
   <LI> the described interfaces are reasonably abstracted
	(understandable and convenient) from the clients' 
	perspective.</li>
   <LI>	the described interfaces are reasonably abstracted
	(clear, implementable, with good information hiding)
	from the component's perspective.</li>
   <LI>	the development can be accomplished with mature and usable tools
	and technology (ideally using off-the-shelf components).</li>
</UL>
<P>
Recall that McConnell described design as a
<em>wicked</em> problem, in that you may not even have a list of
problems to be solved until you have designed (and discarded)
a few solutions.  This is a highly iterative process, and these
iterations may consume a great deal of your time.
Often, the best way to convince ourselves of the feasibility
of an architecture
is to sketch out possible implementations of each major 
component, looking for options and issues.   Such preliminary
research, design, analysis, and prototyping is an important
sanity check on the viability of the proposed architecture.
The goal of these investigations is not to fully design the
major components, but merely to present a compelling argument 
for the "feasibility" of the proposed component descriptions:
<UL>
   <LI>	Where stable off the shelf technology is available, this may
	require no more work than confirming that the the available
	technology supports the required interfaces and functionality.</li>

   <LI> Where newer technology is available, it may be appropriate
	to do a little more research (and/or prototyping) to 
	confirm its usability and suitability for the proposed
	problem.</li>

   <LI>	Where new components must be constructed, it may still
	be possible to use much off-the-shelf technology ... in
	which case the design may be little more than showing how
	existing components can be combined to achieve the required
	functionality.</li>

   <LI>	For new components that must be constructed from scratch,
	it is common to construct a high level design ... with just
	enough detail to convince ourselves that such a component
	is buildable, and unlikely to involve any "hard" problems.</li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
You don't want your architecture to turn into a complete top-down
design for the whole system.  A component analysis only needs to be
complete enough to convince the reviewers that the most of the 
likely problems have been identified, and are all likely to be solveable.
Every major component should be analyzed to this "feasibility" level.
Each member of the team should take ownership of the analysis
for at least one major architectural component.  If you have many
more components than people, each person should choose at least 
one <em>interesting</em> component for thorough analysis or one
interesting question to resolve through a prototyping effort.
</P>
<P>
If you have too many questions and components, it may be impossible
for you to do all of the necessary design and prototyping within a 
few weeks.  After each person has taken on a difficult component or
question, you can do a more superficial job on the simpler questions 
and components (but note explicitly in each that you are doing so).
In the unlikely situation that you have more people than 
interesting components, 
sub-divide your major components to create more pieces or find a
problem that requires further analysis or prototyping.
</P>
<P>
<strong>Your architectural description should include:</strong>
<UL>
   <LI> A high-level prose description of how the required functionality 
	will be delivered.</li>
   <LI> High-level prose descriptions of each of the run-time components:
	what it does (functional specifications), 
	descriptions of its interfaces, and the requirements it must meet.</li>
   <LI> High-level prose descriptions of the major persistent data objects:
	what kind of information they contain, how/where they are stored,
	and (where appropriate) supporting middle-ware (e.g. MySQL).</li>
   <LI>	diagrams illustrating the components, their instantiation/deployment
	in a real system, and their interactions.</li>
   <LI>	(general) characterizations of the external interfaces, and the interfaces
	between the major components.</li>
   <LI> Discussions of the key issues that arose in the development of
	this architecture and the rationale that drove the selection of
	the chosen approach.  </li>
   <LI> Discussions of major issues still outstanding (anything that causes 
	you to doubt that it will be possible to successfully build this system on a
	predictable schedule): what the problem is, what options have been
	considered, and how those options fall short.
	<p>
	Note: outstanding issues are not evidence of failure, but merely 
	recognition of areas where additional work is required.
	The first step in finding help is recognizing that it is needed.
	</p>
	</li>
</UL>
<strong>This should be backed up by a set of component analyses</strong>
(research, designs, analyses, prototypes, etc) that were done to establish 
the feasibility of implementing each major component:
<UL>
   <LI> where existing technology is being used, provide references
	and summarize the investigation you did to determine its
	adequacy and usability.</li>
   <LI>	where analysis was done, provide a write-up of the issues
	investigated, the means of the investigation, and results.</li>
   <LI> where prototyping was done, describe the questions and risks to
	be addressed, a summary of the approach, and the results
	(and github URLs for the actual prototypes constructed).</li>
   <LI>	where new design work was done, provide design documentation
	similar to (but hopefully much simpler than) that described
	for the architectural description.</li>
</UL>
</P>
<H4>Getting Started and Early Feedback</H4>
<P>
To help you through the most difficult parts of this process, we suggest
that you (<u>within first two days</u>):
<ol>
   <li> conceive a list of proposed components.</li>
   <li> prepare a one-line description of what each
        component does and its role in the product.</li>
   <li> draw a diagram showing their relationship to one-another and
        the context in which they run and interact with the outside world.</li>
   <li> prepare a list of the issues (e.g. new technologies, available tools,
        non-obvious APIs, difficult algorithms, etc) 
	that might arise in the implementation of each component.</li>
   <li> schedule a presentation with me (and/or a Grutor) to review
        those component descriptions and concerns.</li>
   <li> get feedback on what else you might need to do before you start
        researching tools, doing prototypes and elaborating designs.</li>
</ol>
Once you have a reasonable model of how your functionality can be
implemented and the questions/risks that must be examined you will
know what research, prototyping and design examinations you need to complete.
But if you do not have a reasonable starting point and list of issues 
to address, you may wind up wasting a few weeks of work, much of which
winds up being thrown away, and does not enable you to move forward.
</P>
<H4>Describing an Architecture</H4>
<P>
There is an old stereotype that scientists and engineers tend not to be good writers.
To the extent there is any truth in this sterotype, it is strange and tragic ...
because story-telling is fundamental to what all researchers and engineers do.
They may spend much of their time doing experiments, models, and designs, but
understandings of complex phenomena and systems are of little value until they 
have been explained to others (who will apply and/or instantiate them).
Scientists and engineers do not (or at least should not, as part of <u>those jobs</u>)
write fiction; 
But they do none-the-less create <u>stories</u> where <u>characters</u>, 
with satisfying <u>backgrounds</u>, fulfill their <u>roles</u>,
and traverse their <u>arcs</u>, 
in accordance with, and exemplifying compelling <u>themes</u>.
You understand the system you have designed;
Now you have to devise a story that will recreate that vision for others:
<ul>
   <li> who are the characters in your story, and what are their roles?</li>
   <li> what descriptions and naratives will most fully portray them?</li>
   <li> what key challenges do they face, and what principles/strategies guide them to success?</li>
   <li> what background is necessary to enable readers to absorb this story?</li>
</ul>
You will note that:
<ul>
   <li> there is much reading on what makes a good architecture </li>
   <li> there are two full lectures on developing and evaluating architectures </li>
   <li> you have (listed above) a two-digit number of things that
        you need to describe about your architecture</li>
</ul>
But I do not give you examples, forms, or even a table of contents for
your architectural description.
There are a few reasons for this:
<UL>
   <LI>	Every system is unique in both structure and constraints, and
	its story probably requires a unique telling.  Giving you 
	samples that did not fit the needs of your particular project
	would probably do more harm than good ... as you tried to force
	your square peg into that round hole.</li>
   <LI>	Among the (difficult and soft) skills we want you to develop 
	are 
	<ul>
	   <li>learning to visualize complex systems</li>
	   <li>developing the ability to communicate those visions in technical prose</li>
	</ul> 
	The ability to describe complex technical concepts and issues is a 
	<u>fundamental skill for any scientist or engineer</u>, 
	and I expect that working out how to best 
	tell this story will prove to be a highly educational exercise.</li>
   <LI> Figuring out the best way to tell the story is far more important
        (and often more difficult) than telling it.  
	Once you have the right outline for your story, 
	drawing the pictures and writing the prose should be relatively straight forward.</li>
</UL>

<H3>P2B Design Review</h3>
</a>
<P>
As we refine a design, we become prone to <em>confirmation bias</em>.
It is easy to become convinced that we have
made the right decision and that our design is therefore correct.
After we have done our best at refining our architecture, it is time
to seek independent validation from people who haven't already bought-in
to our solution.
</P>
<P>
Each team will read over another team's architectural presentation,
prepare detailed notes, conduct a formal design review, produce a
written report, and work with the designing team to ensure reasonable
resolution of all outstanding issues.  You will select a moderator, 
who will work with the submitting team to ensure that the package
is ready for review before it is sent to the rest of your team for
review.  Please document any discussions between your moderator and
the submitting team.
</P>

<a name="desc_2b1">
<h3>P2B.1 Review Notes (per person submissions)</h3>
</a>
<P>
Digesting other peoples' designs is another fundamental skill
for scientists and engineers.
Prior to your review meeting, each of you (individually) will read
the submitted architecture description and prepare detailed notes
on all questions and concerns.  These notes must be submitted at
least 24 hours prior to the actual review session.  They should be
neat notes, describing legitimate issues clearly enough to be sent
as email, and organized for discussion (e.g. in the recommended 
review order).  But these are notes, and there is no need for 
polished prose, or even complete sentences.
</P>
<P>
When you have completed your study notes in preparation for the review,
each individual should prefix them with a
<a href="#submission">standard submission prologue</a>
and submit them (with the name <tt>review_notes_2b.txt</tt>).
</P>
<strong>NOTE: Late points cannot be used for this submission.</strong>
<ul>
   <li>	Full credit if it is submitted 24 hours before the review meeting.</li>
   <li>	50% credit if it is submitted prior to the review meeting.</li>

present to answer questions, but will have no other formal role
in the process.
</P>
<P>
Schedule your review meeting with the professor (or Grutor).  Make sure the
submitting team can get you the architectural package far enough in advance
to enable you to do the required study and prepare your notes prior to the

<P>
The designated scribe for your review session will write up a report
of all conclusions reached in the design review.  This is specifically
not "meeting minutes".  Rather it is a distillation of key issues and
decisions.  It should be carefully written and reviewed.  It must contain:
<UL>
   <LI> a clear summary of each important issue rased</li>

<H3>P2C.1 Revised Architectural Proposal</h3>
</a>
<P>
You will get considerable feedback on your initial architecture proposal
from the professor (or Grutor) and the team that reviews it.  Based
on this feedback, you should revise your architecture to address all
of the must-fix issues, and as many as possible of the should-fix issues.
You will be graded on these resolutions, so make sure you document all
changes made and agreement from the reviewers.
</P>
<P>
Your final proposal is simply a new version of the original proposal, 
revised based on the feedback from the graders and reviewers.
The grading criteria for the revised architectural proposal will be 
similar to the initial architectural presentation, but with the
additional expectation that your rationale and issue discussions
will include issues raised in the reviews, and your design will
have responded to those suggestions:
<UL>
   <li> have all <strong>must-fix</strong> issues have been responded to</li>
   <li> quality of the responses to <strong>must-fix </strong>issues</li>
   <li> quality of the responses <strong>should-fix </strong>issues </li>
</UL>
Please make sure that your final architecture acknowledges this
feedback and explains how you have responded to each item.
</P>
<P>
When your team has addressed all issues and you are ready to submit your final architecture for grading:
<ul>
    <li> create it in either a file on GitHub or a PDF (from a GoogleDoc with history)
         and name it <tt>architecture_2c</tt> (with the format-appropriate suffix)</li>

<H3>P2C.2 Post-Mortem Report</H3>
</a>
<P>
This project is a learning exercise, and one of the major ways
we learn is by analyzing past mistakes.  You will, as a team,
review all aspects of this project.  One of you will then 
summarize that process into a post-mortem analysis report.
</P>
<P>
A report, summarizing the key issues raised in your post-mortem,

The submission and grading of Post Mortem reports is described
in the <a href="#postmortem">General Grading</a> information.
<P>
Make sure that you have kept your meeting minutes and management plan up-to-date on Github.
When you are ready to submit the Post-Mortem report (and management notes) for grading:
<ul>
    <li> prepare your report (ideally ASCII text in a file named <tt>postmortem_2.txt</tt>)</li>
    <li> put a <a href="#submission">standard submission prologue</a> on the front of it</li>
    <li> make sure that it also contains Github URLs for your meeting minutes and management plans</li>
    <li> up-load it to your Sakai Dropbox (only one person on the team needs to do this)</li>
</ul>

<H4>P2C.3 - Work Share Estimates</H4>
<p>
Most of your grade for this project will be based on the team deliverables, but some of it will
be based on the quality, amount, and timeliness of work done by each team member.  Towards this
end, we ask each team member to estimate the
<a href="#work_share">amount of work</a> done by each team member on this project.
Please prepare your own assessment of how much work was done by whom and submit it as
<tt>workshare_2.txt</tt> (or perhaps <tt>workshare_2.csv</tt>).
