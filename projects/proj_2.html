</a>
Architecture and Review
</h1>
</center>
<h2> Introduction</h2>
<P>
Now that you have a well formulated idea of what your product should do, it
is time to figure out how such a product can be built.  This design must
be elaborated and described well enough that outside reviewers can 
evaluate it, assess its feasibility, and identify holes in your design.
This project will exercise a great many key design skills:
</P>
<UL>
   <LI> coming up with a viable high level architecture</li>
   <LI> working out the implications of your architecture to component definitions</li>
   <LI> identifying questions and risks best addressed through prototypes</li>
   <LI> validate your architecture against your requirements (and general goodness properties)</li>
   <LI> describing that architecture well enough that others can understand it</li>
   <LI> reviewing someone else's design, understanding the issues, and
        articulating them in a useful form</li>
   <LI> working the issues that are inevitably discovered to yield
	an architecture that actually has a chance of working.</li>
</UL>
<P>
There are several major parts to this project, each of which has its
own goals, processes, and deliverables:

<H3>P2A.1 Plan</h3>
</a>
<P>
The development of the architecture may prove much more difficult
than you imagine, the process of describing it clearly in writing
may prove extremely challenging, and you will probably discover that
(after your design review) you have a great deal of non-trivial work
to do to fix your design.  Also, remember that design is a <em>wicked</em> 
problem:
<UL>
   <LI> You may not know how many components you 
	have to specify and analyze until your
	architecture is largely complete.</li>
   <LI>	You may not have any sense of how difficult
	the component analyses will be or how many
	iterations you will have to make over the 
	architecture until you have gone through a
	few rounds of revisions and can judge the
	difficulty of the issues and rate of convergence.</li>
   <LI>	You may not have any sense of the number
	or difficulty of the issues that will be raised
	in the design review until after it has been
	completed.</li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
Each of these factors can cause the work to very quickly
grow much larger than your initial estimates.  <u>This means
you need to get budget a great deal of time for revision
and rework, and get started as soon and fast as possible.</u>
</P>
<P>
Each team will prepare a task-breakdown, identify the dependency relationships between
tasks, and owners for each sub-task, assign due-dates, and schedule regular reviews
of both work-products and progress (to enable adequate time to deal with the
<u>problems that will arise</u>).  
A good management plan will include regular status
checks, the results of which should be recorded in the plan document.
</P>
<P>
As your understanding of the problem
evolves and you respond to unanticipated events, 
you will have to revise your plan (not merely estimates, but
the work to be done).
If deadlines are missed, or deliverables fail to pass review, the fact, as well
as the causes and the plan to remedy them must be documented.
</P>
<P>
Your initial Management Plan will be graded on the basis of:
<ul>
	<li> 40% good use of time and resources (work apportioned reasonably over the available time)</li>
	<li> 20% specificity of plan (clear responsibilities: who, what, when)</li>
	<li> 20% provisions for early detection of problems, and time to deal with them</li>
	<li> 20% completeness</li>
</ul>
<P>
Maintain your plan on github. 
You will surely be updating it, and we will be reviewing your history
(changes and comments).
When you are ready to submit them for grading, fill
out the standard form and e-mail it to the submission alias.

<H3>P2A.2 Preliminary Architecture</h3>
</a>
<P>
You will design and specify a set of components that is (in combination)
capable of delivering your version 1.0 product functionality.  
It is tempting to draw some high level pictures and a brief
set of descriptions and call it an architecture ...
but the <em>devil is in the details</em>.
The hard part is working out the implementation and
characteristics of the architecture
in sufficient detail to demonstrate that
the described system is buildable and likely to work:
</p>
<UL>
   <LI>	the described assembly of components is capable
	of delivering the required functionality.</li>
   <LI> each of the described components is 
	reasonably implementable.</li>
   <LI> the described interfaces are reasonably abstracted
	(understandable and convenient) from the clients' 
	perspective.</li>
   <LI>	the described interfaces are reasonably abstracted
	(clear, implementable, with good information hiding)
	from the component's perspective.</li>
   <LI>	the development work is supported by mature and usable tools
	and technology.</li>
</UL>
<P>
Recall that McConnell described design as a
<em>wicked</em> problem, in that you may not even have a list of
problems to be solved until you have designed (and discarded)
a few solutions.  This is a highly iterative process, and these
iterations may consume a great deal of your time.
Often, the best way to convince ourselves of the feasibility
of an architecture
is to sketch out possible implementations of each major 
component, looking for options and issues.   Such preliminary
research, design, analysis, and prototyping is an important
sanity check on the viability of the proposed architecture.
The goal of these investigations is not to fully design the
major components, but merely to present a compelling argument 
for the "feasibility" of the proposed component descriptions:
<UL>
   <LI>	Where stable off the shelf technology is available, this may
	require no more work than confirming that the the available
	technology supports the required interfaces and functionality.</li>

   <LI> Where newer technology is available, it may be appropriate
	to do a little more research (and/or prototyping) to 
	confirm its usability and suitability for the proposed
	problem.</li>

   <LI>	Where new components must be constructed, it may still
	be possible to use much off-the-shelf technology ... in
	which case the design may be little more than showing how
	existing components can be combined to achieve the required
	functionality.</li>

   <LI>	For new components that must be constructed from scratch,
	it is common to construct a high level design ... with just
	enough detail to convince ourselves that such a component
	is buildable, and unlikely to involve any "hard" problems.</li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
You don't want your architecture to turn into a complete top-down
design for the whole system.  A component analysis only needs to be
complete enough to convince the reviewers that the most of the 
likely problems have been identified, and are all likely to be solveable.
Every major component should be analyzed to this "feasibility" level.
Each member of the team should take ownership of the analysis
for at least one major architectural component.  If you have many
more components than people, each person should choose at least 
one <em>interesting</em> component for thorough analysis or one
interesting question to resolve through a prototyping effort.
</P>
<P>
If you have too many questions and components, it will be impossible
for you to do all of the necessary design and prototyping within a 
few weeks.  After each person has taken on a difficult component or
question, you can do a more superficial job on the simpler questions 
and components (but note explicitly in each that you are doing so).
In the unlikely situation that you have more people than 
interesting components, 
sub-divide your major components to create more pieces or find a
problem that requires further analysis or prototyping.
</P>
<P>
Your architectural description should include:
<UL>
   <LI> A high-level prose description of how the required functionality 
	will be delivered.</li>
   <LI> High-level prose descriptions of each of the run-time components:
	what it does, and the requirements it must meet.</li>
   <LI> High-level prose descriptions of the major persistent data objects:
	what kind of information they contain, how/where they are stored,
	and (where appropriate) supporting middle-ware (e.g. MySQL).</li>
   <LI>	diagrams illustrating the components, their instantiation/deployment
	in a real system, and their interactions.</li>
   <LI>	characterizations of the external interfaces, and the interfaces
	between the major components.</li>
   <LI> Discussions of the key issues that arose in the development of
	this architecture and the rationale that drove the selection of
	the chosen approach.  </li>
   <LI> Discussions of major issues still outstanding (anything that causes 
	you to doubt that it will be possible to successfully build this system on a
	predictable schedule): what the problem is, what options have been
	considered, and how those options fall short.</li>
</UL>
This should be backed up by a set of component analyses (research,
designs, analyses, prototypes, etc) that were done to establish 
the feasibility of implementing each major component:
<UL>
   <LI> where existing technology is being used, provide references
	and summarize the investigation you did to determine its
	suitability.</li>
   <LI>	where analysis was done, provide a write-up of the issues
	investigated, the means of the investigation, and results.</li>
   <LI> where prototyping was done, describe the risk issues to
	be addressed, a summary of the approach and results, 
	and github URLs for the actual prototypes constructed.</li>
   <LI>	where new design work was done, provide design documentation
	similar to (but hopefully much simpler than) that described
	for the architectural description.</li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
You will note that, while I do describe what should be present in your
architectural description (and there are two full lectures on the
elements of good architecture), I am not giving you sample architectural
descriptions.  
There are two reasons for this:
<UL>
   <LI>	Every system is unique in both structure and constraints, and
	its story probably requires a unique telling.  Giving you 
	samples that did not fit the needs of your particular project
	would probably do more harm than good ... as you tried to force
	my square peg into your round hole.</li>
   <LI>	Among the (difficult and soft) skills that I want you to develop 
	are learning to visualize complex systems, and express those 
	visions technical prose.  The ability to describe complex
	technical concepts and issues is a fundamental skill for
	any engineer, and I expect that working out how to best 
	tell your story will prove to be a highly educational exercise.</li>

<H3>P2B Design Review</h3>
</a>
<P>
As we refine a design, it is easy to become convinced that we have
made the right decision and that our design is therefore correct.
After we have done our best at refining our architecture, it is time
to seek independent validation from people who haven't already bought-in
to our solution.
</P>
<P>
Each team will read over another team's architectural presentation,
prepare detailed notes, conduct a formal design review, produce a
written report, and work with the designing team to ensure reasonable
resolution of all outstanding issues.  You will select a moderator, 
who will work with the submitting team to ensure that the package
is ready for review before it is sent to the rest of your team for
review.  Please document any discussions between your moderator and
the submitting team.
</P>

<a name="desc_2b1">
<h3>P2B.1 Review Notes</h3>
</a>
<P>
Prior to your review meeting, each of you (individually) will read
the submitted architecture description and prepare detailed notes
on all questions and concerns.  These notes must be submitted at
least 24 hours prior to the actual review session.  They should be
neat notes, describing legitimate issues clearly enough to be sent
as email, and organized for discussion (e.g. in the recommended 
review order).

<P>
The designated scribe for your review session will write up a report
of all conclusions reached in the design review.  This is specifically
not "meeting minutes".  Rather it is a distillation of key issues and
decisions.  It should be carefully written and reviewed.  It must contain:
<UL>
   <LI> a clear summary of each important issue rased</li>
   <LI> a characterization as a defect, question, or issue</li>
   <LI> a characterization as must-fix, should-fix, or comment</li>

<H3>P2C.1 Revised Architectural Proposal</h3>
</a>
<P>
You will get considerable feedback on your initial architecture proposal
from the professor (or Grutor) and the team that reviews it.  Based
on this feedback, you should revise your architecture to address all
of the must-fix issues, and as many as possible of the should-fix issues.
You will be graded on these resolutions, so make sure you document all
changes made and agreement from the reviewers.
</P>
<P>
Your final proposal is simply a new version of the original proposal, 
revised based on the feedback from the graders and reviewers.
The grading criteria for the revised architectural proposal will be 
similar to the initial architectural presentation, but with the
the architectural rationale and issue understanding points based
on your responses to raised issues:
<UL>
   <li> have all <strong>must-fix</strong> issues have been responded to</li>
   <li> quality of the responses to <strong>must-fix </strong>issues</li>
   <li> quality of the responses <strong>should-fix </strong>issues </li>
</UL>
Please make sure that your final architecture acknowledges this
feedback and explains how you have responded to each item.

<H3>P2C.2 Post-Mortem Report</H3>
</a>
<P>
This project is a learning exercise, and one of the major ways
we learn is by analyzing past mistakes.  You will, as a team,
review all aspects of this project.  One of you will then 
summarize that process into a post-mortem analysis report.
</P>
<P>
A report, summarizing the key issues raised in your post-mortem,
and the conclusions you came to.  Your post-mortem discussion 
should include:
<ul>
	<li> creation of the initial architecture</li>
	<li> initial refinement of the architecture</li>
	<li> component design analyses</li>
	<li> creating draft architectural description</li>
	<li> studying for your design review</li>
	<li> the design review meeting (as a reviewer)</li>
	<li> the design review meeting (as a reviewee)</li>
	<li> writing up the review report and working the issues</li>
	<li> revising your architecture to address the issues</li>
	<li> the planning and ongoing management of these activities</li>
	<li> the overall project as an educational exercise</li>

<P>
Note that if you make no mistakes, you will not be able to earn any points
on the post-mortem.  Fortunately, no teams have ever found it necessary
to deliberately make mistakes in order to have something to analyze.
