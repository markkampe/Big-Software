(due Sunday night, as per team <strong>sakai assignments</strong> submission)

<ul>
   <li> <font size="+1">P1D.1 Final Proposal</font>
      <ul>
      	<li> What subset of the functionality (based on value and/or interest)
	     do you plan to do this semester?</li>
      	<li> Are you writing your final proposal for the entire product,
	     or only for the work you plan to do this semester?</li>
	<li> If the latter, how will you justify the value of the proposed work
	     (e.g. questions it will explore, concepts it will prove, foundation it will lay)?
	</li>
      </ul> </li>
   <li> <font size="+1">P1D.2 Post-Mortem</font>
      <ul>
      	<li> concept definition, planning, research and brain-storming activities</li>
	<li> creation of the concept presenation</li>
	<li> user requirements elicitation planning, execution, and results analysis</li>
	<li> organization and creation of the final proposal</li>
	<li> the on-going planning and management process</li>
        <li> overall project as an educational exercise</li>
      </ul> </li>

      <ul>
	<li> What are the major components of the complete product, and the 
	     key functionality and interfaces for each?<br>
            (Even if you plan to build only a small subset of an entire product,
	     you still need to show the entire architecture into which they fit)</li>

	<li> What are the key inter-component relationships, and how (e.g. with
	     what representation) do you plan to describe them?</li>

	<li> What components are already available <em>off the shelf</em>?</li>

	<li> What new (to you) technology will you be using, for which you 
	     should do some preliminary mine-sweeping investigations?</li>
      </ul> </li>
