	<li> Which component(s) will you design? </li>

        <li> What is your plan for negotiating its interface specifications with 
	     the other members of your team?</li>

	<li> What problems to you expect to be most difficult, and what will
	     you need (beyond time) to address them?</li>

	<li> When will you have your first draft specifications, design, and 
	     test plans available for review? </li>

	<li> Who will review your specifications, design, and test plan?  When? </li>
      </ul> </li>
   <li> <font size="+1">P3A.2 Component Specifications</font> (per person)
      <ul>
	<li> Do you know what language your component(s) will be implemented in,
	     and have you settled on appropriate interface definition languages
	     (e.g. JavaDoc, PyDoc, Doxygen)?</li>

       	<li> Can you, today, enumerate (w/o complete interface specifications), 
	     all of your public entry points?</li>

	<li> Which of your public interfaces are obvious, and which need to be discussed? </li>

	<li> Can you, today, enumerate (w/o complete interface specifications),
	     all of the requests you will need to make from other components
	     and external services?</li>

        <li> Do you understand (and have you already written code that uses) all
	     of the external services you require? </li>

	<li> Have you started negotiating interfaces with the other components
	     you have to call?  If so, do you have any concerns about their
	     adequacy?</li>

	<li> Given the above, do you see any other problems associated with writing
	     detailed interface specifications for all of your public methods?</li>
      </ul> </li>
   <P>
   <li> <font size="+1">P3B Moving Forward</font>
      <ul>
   	<li> Do you already understand (at a high level) how you plan to implement
	     each of your public methods?</li>

	<li> Do those implementations have sufficient <em>observability</em> and
	     <em>controlability</em> to give you confidence that you will be able
	     to thoroughly test them?</li>
        <li> Is it clear to you how you will use what testing framework to perform
	     that testing?</li>
      </ul> </li>
