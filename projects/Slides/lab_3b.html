       	<li> Do you know how you will implement each of your public methods? </li>
	<li> Have you defined the functionality and interface specifications for
	     any necessary private methods?</li>
       	<li> Do you know how you will make (and process the results of) every call you 
	     make to another component?</li>
       	<li> Do you know how you will make (and process the results of) every call you 
	     make to an external service?</li>
        <li> Is it clear to you what <em>mock</em> implementations you will need for
	     your calls to other components (for unit testing)?</li>
      </ul> </li>
   <li> <font size="+1">P3B.2 Component Test Plans</font>
      <ul>
       	<li> Do you have a list of the functionality to be verified? </li>
        <li> Do you have a list of the assertions to be verified for each function? </li>
	<li> Do you have adequate <em>controlability</em> of the functions and their context
	     to exercise those assertions?</li>
	<li> Do you know where you will get the <em>mock</em> implementations of other 
	     components (to support each of these test cases)?</li>
	<li> Do you have adequate <em>observability</em> of component state to confidently
	     verify correct execution?</li>
	<li> Is it clear to you how to implement each of those test cases in your chosen
	     testing framework?</li>
      </ul> </li>

      <ul>
   	<li> Have you identified reviewers and set a schedule for the review of
	     your design(s) and test plan(s)?</li>
        <li> Is there any rationale (or research/prototyping results) that those
	     reviewers should understand before they review your design and
	     test plan?</li>
	<li> Will the reviewer(s) need any background on the external services 
	     or tool kits you will be using? </li>
	<li> Will the reviewer(s) need any background on the testing framework
	     you propose to use for your automated unit testing? </li>
      </ul> </li>
