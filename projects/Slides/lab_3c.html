      <ul>
       	<li> Have you received all of the materials you need to review, and
	     do you have a schedule for the review session?</li>
	<li> Are those materals adequate to enable you to review the proposed
	     design(s) and test plan(s)?
        <li> Will you have been able to review those materials and prepare
	     your notes prior to that review session?</li>
      </ul> </li>
   <li> <font size="+1">P3C.2 Review and Report</font>
      <ul>
       	<li> Have you assigned roles (e.g. scribe and facilitator) for each review? </li>
        <li> Do you have a schedule for when your review report will be published to the team? </li>
      </ul> </li>

   <li> <font size="+1">P3D Moving Forward</font>
      <ul>
   	<li> Do you already understand the areas where issues may be raised, and have you
	     allowed sufficient time to address them? </li>
      </ul> </li>
   </P>
   <li> <font size="+1">P4 Moving Forward</font>
      <ul>
   	<li> It is suggested that you represent all of the interfaces and implementation notes
	     in per-module files of code and test cases, and create the build automation to
	     compile and run (even while they are only skeltons). 
	     This will expose all of your code to the other members of your team as quickly
	     as possible, and enable <em>continous integration</em>.
