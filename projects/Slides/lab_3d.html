      <ul>
   	<li> It is suggested that you represent all of the interfaces and implementation notes
	     in per-module files of code and test cases, and create the build automation to
	     compile and run (even while they are only skeltons). 
	     This will expose all of your code to the other members of your team as quickly
	     as possible, and enable <em>continous integration</em>.
