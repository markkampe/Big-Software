   <li> <font size="+1">P4B.1 Pair Programming</font>
      <ul>
       	<li> choose a module of sufficient complexity (to justify pair programming) </li>
        <li> decide on your respective roles </li>
	<li> ensure that all commit comments respect the respective contributions of each developer</li>
	<li> write up a report on:
	<ul>
	   <li> the roles you assumed, and why you felt those to be good choices</li>
	   <li> how effectively each person's time and skills were used</li>
	   <li> the speed and quality of the development process (vs working alone)</li>
	   <li> pleasant and unpleasant aspects of the experience</li>
	   <li> what you would do differently next time</li>
	</ul>
      </ul> </li>
   <li> <font size="+1">P4B.2 Code Review</font>
      <ul>
       	<li> choose a module of sufficient complexity (to be worthy of review) </li>
	<li> prior to testing:
	<ul>
           <li> prepare a review package and submit it for review by other team members </li>
	   <li> conduct a review, producing a written report </li>
	   <li> address all raised issues from the review </li>
        </ul>
	</li>
        <li> complete the testing </li>
	<li> document how the testing went, and what (if any) problems were subsequently found (in
	     either unit-testing or integration)</li>
      </ul> </li>
   <li> <font size="+1">P4B.3 Test Driven Devlopment</font>
      <ul>
       	<li> choose a module of sufficient complexity (to requre a significant number of
	     non-trivial test cases) </li>
	<li> consider the order in which you should implement your methods and classes
	     (some may not be testable until others are available)</li>
       	<li> write and commit each test case <u>before</u> committing the code to be tested.</li>
	<li> when you commit the (successfully running) code, describe the tests that have 
	     been passed and whether or not those tests turned up any problems in the 
	     initial code.</li>
        <li> when you write up your report, discuss how efficient and helpful you found
	     the process to be, and the circumstances under which you would or would
	     not use it in the future</li>
      </ul> </li>
