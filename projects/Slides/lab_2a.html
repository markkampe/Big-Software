   <li> <font size="+1">P2A.1 Phase 2 Plan</font>
      <ul>
	<li> Who will create the required whole-architecture descriptions, and
	     when will they be reviewed by the team?</li>

        <li> Who will write the detailed functional specifications for each of the
	     components to be implemented, and when will they be reviewed by the team?</li>

	<li> Who will review your architecture, and who's architecture will you review?<br>
	     Line these up and schedule those reviews.</li>

        <li> What additional research (how to do things) or prototyping (using new tools,
	     or validating an approach) do you need to firm up your proposal?
	     Who is going to do it, on what schedule?</li>
      </ul> </li>

   <li> <font size="+1">P2A.2 Preliminary Architecture</font>
      <ul>
      	<li> What subset of the functionality do you plan to do this semester?</li>
	<li> What are the components (to build or bring up) that will implement
	     that functionality?</li>
      	<li> How much of the whole-product architecture do you need to describe
	     in how much detail to:
	     <ol type="a">
	        <li> show how the full-product functionality can be delivered </li>
		<li> <u>fully illustrate the roles</u> of the components to be implemented </li>
	        <li> represent <u>all of the interfaces</u> of the components to be implemented</li>
		<li> provide an adequate foundation for discussing 
		     <u>all of the functional requirements</u> on the components to be implemented</li>
	     </ol></li>
        <li> What descriptions, in what forms, will be required to tell these stories?</li>
      </ul> </li>

   <P>
   <li> <font size="+1">P2B Moving Forward</font>
      <ul>
	<li> What updates (or additional background material) do you want to make 
	     to your architecture before you forward it to your reviewers?</li>

        <li> How much time will you need to study the architecture you will
	     be reviewing?  Will you receive that proposal with adequate time
	     to do that study?</li>

        <li> Schedule (both of) your architectural reviews.</li>
      </ul> </li>
