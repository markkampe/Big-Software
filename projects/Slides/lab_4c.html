      <ul>
        <li> build a complete product by combining all
	    of your individual components.</li>
        <li> define and implement whole-system test cases that show
	     all of these components to be <u>working together</u>.</li>
        <li> automate the whole-system build and test process.</li>
      </ul> </li>

      <ul>
	<li> you will give a presentation covering:

		<li> the (original product) requirements that have been met</li>
	        <li> the components that have been implemented</li>
		<li> the scope of the automated unit testing</li>

	     <ul>
	        <li> a clone of your repo(s)</li>
	        <li> a complete build (from scratch) of all components</li>
		<li> a run (and pass) all of your automated unit-test suite(s)</li>
      	     </ul> 
       	</li>
        <li> you will run a demonstration which shows the
