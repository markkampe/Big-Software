It is unlikely that your design and test plan review has left you with much
rework to do.  If this proves to be the case, there should be very little work
required to revise your designs and test plans, and write up your project 3
post mortem.

This gives you an opportunity to get an early start on the (project 4) final
implementation.  It is likely that the end of the semester will be a very busy
time for you, and spreading (the much greater) project 4 out over three weeks
(rather than two) may significantly improve the quality of your life.

At the very least, you should (as a team) decide, based on your components
and interests, which of you would like to:
   * do your implementation in pair-programming sessions
   * do your implementation using Test Driven Development
   * submit your completed code for a Code Review

and ... who would like to take the responsibility of planning the final demo?
