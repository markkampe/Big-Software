Now that you have defined the project you propose to implement, the next
step is working out its high level architecture.  Many students consider
this to be the most difficult project assignment, because it starts with
a blank sheet of paper, and must respond to problems that we do not yet
fully understand.  This means you want to get started as soon as possible.

Start by reading through all of the Project 2 instructions (parts A-C).
In the next week you will:
   * identify technologies, languages and toolkits to be used
   * explore the applicabiltity of those tools to your problem and
     their usability in this particular context
   * brain-storm possible architectures (components, roles, interfaces)
   * examine the reasonableness of that architecture and the implmentability
     of those components
   * do any research and prototyping (e.g. confirming that you can get
     and use the proposed tools, and understanding the structures that
     they will impose on your design) required to answer the above questions

I would encourage you to ASAP (before Tuesday):
   1. prepare a brief descriptions of proposed components, their functions
      and relationsthips.
   2. prepare a list of the major tools you propose to use, and why you
      believe you will be able to use them successfully.
   3. present these to me to review them for potential problems.
   4. get feedback on the next research, design, and prototyping steps
