Now that you have an architecture that you believe to be both viable and
implementable, it is time to subject those beliefs to external validation.

In the next week you will:
   * identify another team who is willing and able to review your architecture
   * send them your architecture, schedule and conduct a review

   * agree to review another team's architecture
   * review their proposed architecture
   * schedule and conduct a review (observed by me or a Grutor)
   * write up a report on the results of that review

I would encourage you to ASAP (e.g. during today's lab):
   1. talk to the other teams and determine who will you reivew your architecture,
      and who's architecture you will review.
   2. schedule your architectural reviews with those teams and me (or a Grutor) to:
      - give yourself adequate time to study and make notes on the proposal
      - give yourself adequate time to consider and write up your report
