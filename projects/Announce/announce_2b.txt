Now that you have an architecture that you believe to be both viable and
implementable, it is time to subject those beliefs to external validation.

In the next week you will:
   * line up another team who is willing and able to review your architecture
   * send them your architecture, schedule and conduct a review

   * agree to review another team's architecture
   * review their proposed architecture
   * schedule and conduct a review (observed by me or a Grutor)
   * write up a report on the results of that review

Hopefully, you already know which project you will be reviewing, and which
team will be reviewing your project.  If you do not, you must tie this down
immediately.

Schedule your architectural reviews with those teams and me (or a Grutor) to:
      - give yourself adequate time to study and make notes on the proposal
      - give yourself adequate time to consider and write up your report

Notes: 
      Your reviewers may have questions about why you have chosen to do
      things in the proposed ways.  It would probably be useful to give
      them a copy of your final proposal, as background for the architecture
      that will implement it.

      Your reviewers have may not be familiar with the technologies you propose
      to use.  Architectural documents seldom include tutorials on those 
      technologies, but it would be good to provide a brief summary of the
      technologies you will be using, including URLs for overviews that
      the reviewers might find valuable.
