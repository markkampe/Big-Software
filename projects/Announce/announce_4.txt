Given your well-considered and reviewed designs and test plans, the actual
implementation should go fairly quickly.  But a few of the activities
(e.g. pair programming and code review) involve multiple people and will
have to be scheduled, and the integration process often turns up unexpected
problems.  I would encourage you to try to get all of the implementations
and unit testing completed during the next week.

If so, the only work remaining would be
   * running through the checkout, build, and test scenario
   * creating the demo of integrated functionality
   * preparing the sprint review presentation
   * scheduling and presenting the sprint review
   * discussing and writing up your final post-mortem

There are a few things on this list, but most of them should be simple
and trouble-free.  Hopefully allowing you more time to deal with final
deliverables for your other classes.
