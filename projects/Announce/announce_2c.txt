Most of the reviews/reports have been graded and feedback put in your dropboxes.
Having completed your architectural reviews, you should now have a clear
list of issues to be addressed:

Each reviewing team should, as quickly as possible:
   * examine the feedback they got on their review report
   * update their report as they think appropriate
   * forward that report to the team you reviewed So that they can get on the
     required architectural revisions as quickly as possible.

After which each reviewed team should:
   * review the results of your architectural review (my comments, your
     own notes and the report from the reviewing team)
   * research and identify design changes to address those issues
   * confirm the reasonableness of those results with the reviewers
   * write up a revised architectural proposal in which you specifically
     identify those issues and the way in which each has been addressed

Must-Fix problems and issues are not respects in which the document
(or even the architecture) could be improved, but things that are
likely to result in serious problems for the project (e.g. components
that could not be implemented or would not work, missing information
without which a component could not be designed, or that makes it
impossible to conclude whether or not a component or system would work).

I suggest that you schedule your follow-up meeting with the other team
as soon as possible, to ensure that you will be able to get their feedback
before doing the work to make those changes.
