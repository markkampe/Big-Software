Most of the reviews/reports have been graded and feedback put in your dropboxes.
Having completed your architectural reviews, you should now have a clear
list of issues to be addressed:

Each reviewing team should, as quickly as possible:
   * examine the feedback they got on their review report
   * update their report as they think appropriate
   * forward that report to the team you reviewed So that they can get on the
     required architectural revisions as quickly as possible.

After which each reviewed team should:
   * review the results of your architectural review (both your
     own notes and the report from the reviewing team)
   * research and identify design changes to address those issues
   * confirm the reasonableness of those results with the reviewing team
   * write up a revised architectural proposal in which you specifically
     identify those issues and the way in which each has been addressed

Two general observations about the reports (that may factor in to your revisions)

   1. Many questions were based on things the reviewing team did not understand
      about the proposed product or technologies.  Such material is generally
      treated, not as part of the architectural proposal, but as background
      reading for it.
      
    2. Must-Fix problems and issues are not respects in which the document
       (or even the architecture) could be improved, but things that are
       likely to result in serious problems for the project (e.g. components
       that could not be implemented or would not work, missing information
       without which a component could not be designed, or that makes it
       impossible to conclude whether or not a component or system would work).

I suggest that you schedule your follow-up meeting with the other team
as soon as possible, to ensure that you will be able to get their feedback
before doing the work to make those changes.
