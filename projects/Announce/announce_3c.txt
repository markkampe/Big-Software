Given your specifications, designs, and test plans, conducting design reviews
with your team-mates should be relatively quick and easy.  But, over the next
week, you will each have to:
   * study for and participate in three other reviews
   * write up a report on your own review
   * understand and work any issues that are raised in your own review

Recognize that, as your team mates read your detailed designs, they may
find that there have been misunderstandings about exactly what your
component will do.  As a result, these review sessions may go longer
than expected, and generate more design work, requiring additional
reviews.

I suggest that you get together, as a team, as soon as possible and lay out
a schedule to spread that work out over the next week, leaving enough time 
to deal with the issues that arise in those reviews.
