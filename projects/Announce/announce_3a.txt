Most of the remaining project work will focus on the components that you
will (as individuals) specify, design, implement and test.  The first 
steps in this process are selecting the component(s) to be implemented,
and planning the implementation work.

I suggest that, over the next few days:
   * you begin by reading the descriptions for all of the remaining project
     phases (3A-3E and 4) so that you understand what you will need to be
     able to do with the selected component(s).
   * identify the component(s) you will want to specify, design, implement,
     and test.
   * describe a meaningful demonstration (for the project 4 sprint review)
     of successful integration of those components.  If this is difficult,
     perhaps you would like to choose different components.
   * come up with a detailed plan for the work to be done.

This should not be very difficult, so I would then encourage you to get an
early start on the specifications, designs, and test plans for those
components.
