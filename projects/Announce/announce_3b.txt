While writing your component specifications, you have likely given more than
a little thought to how you would implement your component.  But ...
   * as you work on the detailed design, you may find that some of the
     algorithms, data structures, communication or house-keeping are not
     as obvious as you thought.
   * once you have chosen your algorithms, it may not be obvious what
     the test cases to fully exercise their correctness might be.

For these reasons, I would encourage you to start sketching the algorithms
and test cases as soon as possible.  If you encounter no hard problems,
congratulations!  But if you do encounter problems, it would be good to
have them in mind for discussion (with your team, with me, or with a
Grutor) at Friday's lab session.
