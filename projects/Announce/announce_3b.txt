Given your overall product requirements and architecture, it might be fairly
straight-forward to write-up the functionality, interfaces, and requirements
for your selected components.  But ...
   * the interfaces described in your architecture may not yet be sufficiently
     complete or detailed to guide a complete component specification.
   * some of the functionality may be defined with respect to services
     performed for (or obtained from) other (not yet fully specified)
     components.
   * there may be some further design and/or discussion required in order
     to derive specific component requirements from the overall product
     requirements.

Thus, you may find it necessary to (as a team) further elaborate the
architecture and explore possible implementations of other components
before you can fully specify your chosen components.

I would encourage you to examine what you currently know about your chosen
components and see what other details need to be worked out before you can
write detailed specifications and requirements.  If you can have this done
before next Friday's lab, the per-component write-ups should be relatively
straight-forward.
