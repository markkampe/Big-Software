Welcome to Software Engineering

My name is Mark Kampe.  I have spent almost 50 years building operating systems
...  critical code that enables hundreds of millions of people to exploit the
power of computers and networks.  In addition to building operating systems,
I have driven product evolution, built software development organizations, and
guided the growth of many engineers.

Several years ago I realized that I could probably do pretty-much whatever
I wanted ... and that part of what I wanted was to help the next generation
of engineers do amazing things ... and save them the trouble of making so
many of the terrible mistakes I have seen (and made).   I expect that
software development will, in one way or another, play a significant role
in all of your future careers, and I want you to meet those challenges with
a good foundation of understanding, perspective and methodology.

It is my intention that this course will develop:
   - your ability to organize and effectively manage large, complex team projects
   - your ability to gather, define, clarify and validate requirements for
     non-trivial software projects.
   - methodologies to approach the creation of good specifications,
     architecture, designs, and test plans for efficient and robust software.
   - your ability to understand, describe, and review complex software systems
     and development processes.
   - an understanding of a range of software development processes and the types
     of project to which they are best suited.
   - your ability to recognize, analyze, discuss, and address the problems that
     arise in such efforts.

Logistical Details

   All lecture and lab sessions will be conducted remotely, via Zoom:

Preparation

   1. Course web site: You might want to review the syllabus and FAQ.

   2. Piazza: There is a simple logistical survey (about your resources
      and tool familiarities).  Please fill it out so that we can identify
      any issues that must be addressed.

   3. Piazza: There is a second posting where I ask each of us to introduce
      ourselves, why we are here, what we bring with us, and what we hope to
      get from this course.  Please post your own introduction.

   4. Projects and Teams: In order to develop and exercise significant
      Software Engineering skills, you will be asked to form teams and define
      (your own) relatively large and complex projects.  You might want to:
      - look at the summary of project activities on the course home page.
      - give some thought to what projects you might want to pursue.
      - give some thought to who else (in this section) you want to work with.

I look forward to reading your introductions, and to our first meeting on Tuesday.
Please feel free to email me with any questions,
