Welcome to Software Engineering Team

My name is Mark Kampe.  I have spent almost 50 years building operating systems
(platform support, multi-processor, distributed, ...) and have driven product
evolution, built software development organizations, and guided the growth of
many engineers.  I am now retired from that day-job, but continue teaching
(a) for fun and (b) to give back to a field that has given me so much.

THE COURSE

The course web site can be found at
    https://www.cs.hmc.edu/courses/2020/fall/cs121s1

The parts you are likely to find most interesting are:
    the schedule: https://www.cs.hmc.edu/courses/2020/fall/cs121s1/schedule.html
    the projects: https://www.cs.hmc.edu/courses/2020/fall/cs121s1/projects.html

I haven't taught this course for Harvey Mudd in several years, so none of you
will have taken my version of this course.  The SWE curriculum is fairly
standard, but one (relatively) unique thing about this course is that I ask
student teams to work on a single project that is too big to reasonably
finish with a small team in one semester.  Why?

   - a project small enough to be done by a few people in a few weeks is too
     small to involve much in the way of "software engineering".

   - I want them to go through all of the major activities (and encounter the
     kinds of problems) that would be involved in a Clinic-sized (or larger)
     team project.

THE GRUTOR ROLE

I expect to handle all of the quiz and exam grading, and to answer most
of the subject questions that are posted to Piazza.  I expect that most
of the student need for help will come, not from the academic material,
but from these projects.

Because the projects will all be long, different and moderately complex, I
suggest that we try to have a single person work with each team for the
entire semester:
   - regular status meetings on how they are progressing
   - advising them on problems that arise during each week
   - grading the weekly submissions, and providing feedback
     on how to move forward

SUGGESTED LOGISTICS

I suggest that we Zoom together late in the first week and review all of 
the project proposals.  Each of you can choose one or two teams you
would like to work with, and I will take the remainder.

All assignments are due Sunday at midnight.  Each week's work is based
on the results of the preceding week, so I would like to provide feedback
as quickly as possible.  I suggest that we schedule a (weekly) Monday Zoom
session to, as a group, do (first pass grading).

Then (perhaps on Tuesday) we can have a second Zoom to discuss the current
week's assignment, what must be done, likely problems, and the grading rubric
(so we can guide people to the best results).

I should be available (at least by email) almost all the time, and have
Zoom access most of the time.  When particular problems come up, we can
deal with them in email, chats, or Zooms.

Does this sound like a reasonable plan?

Thank you for your help, and I look forward to working with you,
