<h2>Typical (concept definition) Quiz question, and full-credit answer</h2>
<p>
</p><ul>
<p class="quest">
1. What is "white box testing"?
</p><p class="ansr">
White box test cases are based on the design of the component to be tested,
and attempt to ensure that all interesting cases/branches are covered.
</p></ul>

<h2>Typical (concept definition) Exam question, and full-credit answer</h2>

</p><ul>
<p class="quest">
2. Briefly define the following three tearms, taking care that your definitions
make clear the distinction between them:<br>
(a) requirements
</p><p class="ansr">
(often user-facing) characteristics a successful solution must have.
</p>
<p class="quest">
(b) specifications
</p><p class="ansr">
a complete description of the interfaces and behavior that a component
must have to correctly perform its role in the system.
</p>
<p class="quest">
(c) design
</p><p class="ansr">
a description of the internal data, methods, and algorithms that will
be used to implement a component.
</p>
</ul>

3. Draw a UML diagram for the interaction between a user and digital camera, 
where a half-press checks focus/exposure (confirmed w/lights), and a full 
press takes a picture (confirmed w/beep).

<UL>
<p class="quest">
4. (a) What (in the context of testing) is an equivalence partition?
</p><p class="ansr">
	For parameters that have a wide range of possible values, an
	equivalence partition is a set of values that should all be
	processed in the same way.
</p><p class="quest">
   (b) Why is this an important concept for test case design?
</p><p class="ansr">
	If all values in an equivalence class are processed in the same
	way, we might only need to test a single value from each
	equivalence class.
</p><p class="quest">
   (c) Suggest a numeric function (with a wide range of parameter values)
       and a likely set of test case equivalence classes.
</p><p class="ansr">
	For the factorial function, the obvious equivalence classes might be 1, 
	greater positive integers, -1, smaller negative integers, and 0.
</p><p class="quest">
   (d) Suggest a non-numeric function (with a wide range of possible
       input situations) and a likely set of test case equivalence classes.
</p><p class="ansr">
	An insertion into an ordered list should be tested for an empty list,
	before the first element, between two elements, and after the last element.

</p><h2>Typical (find an approach) Exam question, and full credit answer</h2>
<p>
<UL>
<p class="quest">
5. Consider two multi-user change-control strategies, and explain
(or give an example) why each of these might be the better solution.
<br>
   (a) When <tt>user2</tt> attempts to <em>check out</em> (for modification) a module
   a module that <tt>user1</tt> has already checked out, (s)he is blocked
   (until <tt>user1</tt> commits or aborts).
</p><p class="ansr">
If <tt>user1</tt> and <tt>user2</tt> work are making changes to the same module, they should
talk to one another ... because the changes that one person is making might
invalidate or change the other person's plans.  Blocking the <em>check out</em>
alerts <tt>user2</tt> that (s)he should talk to <tt>user1</tt>.
</p><p class="quest">
   (b) When a <tt>user2</tt> attempts to <em>push</em> new commits to a repo where
   those modules have been changed since <tt>user2</tt>'s last <em>pull</em>,
   it is blocked (until <tt>user2</tt> can prepare a new <em>merge</em> that
   correctly combines those changes).
</p><p class="ansr">
If this is a large Open Source project with contributors all over the world,
it may not be practical to expect all contributors to be in constant communication
with all others, and it would be totally unacceptable for one person's
<em>check-out</em> to paralyze hundreds of other developers.  In such a situation,
<em>ex post facto</em> conflict resolution may be the better course.

<p class="quest">
6. (a) Explain the inevitability of <em>defect amplification</em>.
</p><p class="ansr">
If a mistake made in phase N is not discovered until later, work in subsequent
phases will have been based on that error, and may have to be discarded and redone.
</p><p class="quest">
(b) briefly describe two processes to minimize requirements errors (before they can be amplified).
</p><p class="ansr">
We can seek validation from multiple (and different types of) users for every requirement,
and ensure we have (real world) use cases from which each requirment arises.
Where requirements seem to be speculative, we can try to create prototypes from which
we can get more realistic feedback.
</p><p class="quest">
(c) briefly describe two processes to minimize architectural errors (before they can be amplified).
</p><p class="ansr">
An architectural proposal should be reviewed by a group of people with experience in this
problem domain.  Mine-sweeping projects should test the usability of new technogies, and
mechanism prototypes should be built to assess the viability of novel approaches.
</p><p class="quest">
(d) briefly describe two processes to minimize coding errors (before they can be amplified).
</p><p class="ansr">
Code reviews let other sets of eyes review our implementations, and 
comprehensive test planning (perhaps including Test Driven Development)
provide an objective sanity check for our implementaitons.

<UL>
<p class="quest">
7. Give two significant and completely distinct reasons why <u>large
   projects</u>, in <u>new areas</u>, predicated on <u>Big Requirements Up Front</u>
   might be likely to fail:
</p><p class="ansr">
   <font color="green">(a)</font> if interviewed users do not already have experience with this type
       of product, their requirements suggestions are likely to be speculative.
</p><p class="ansr">
   <font color="green">(b)</font> if the project will take a long time to complete, it is possible that
       both the competition and available technologies will have changed
       by the time the product is ready.
</p><p class="quest">
   (c) describe how an <u>incremental release model</u> would address these issues.
</p><p class="ansr">
	Don't try to deliver all features in a single release.
	We would deliver incremental features in small batches, and use feedback from each release
	to get better (more reliable, based on real experience) requirements for the
	next set of features.  Smaller releases could be developed more quickly, greatly
	reducing the danger of our requirements or approach becoming obsolete.
</p><p class="quest">
   (d) describe how a <u>spiral development model</u> would address these issues.
</p><p class="ansr">
	We could construct prototypes of proposed implementations, ask users
	to test them out, and use that feedback to develop more realistic
	requirements.
