<h2>Typical Quiz question, and full-credit answer</h2>
<p>
</p><ul>
<p class="quest">
What is "white box testing"?
</p><p class="ansr">
White box tests are based on the
design of the component to be tested.
</p></ul>

<h2>Typical concept Exam question, and full-credit answer</h2>
<p>
</p><ul>
<p class="quest">
Define "Legacy Software", and explain why it is difficult to maintain.
</p><p>
</p><p class="ansr">
	Legacy software is software that is old, but is still used for
	critical business functions, and that the customers don't want
	to replace (for fear of disrupting their business).
</p><p class="ansr">
	It is hard to maintain because it has far-outlived its design,
	is technologically obsolete, increasingly hard to add new
	features to, and the original designers are long gone.
</p></ul>
</p><p>
</p><h2>Typical practical Exam question, and full-credit answer</h2>
<p>
</p><ul>
<p class="quest">
Create a UML diagram for the interaction between a user and digital camera, 
where a half-press checks focus/exposure (confirmed w/lights), and a full 
press takes a picture (confirmed w/beep).

</p><h2>Typical difficult Exam question, and full credit answer</h2>
<p>
</p><ul>
<p class="quest">
Consider the version and change control needs of two different environments, 
and suggest an appropriate source tree strategy and version/change control 
discipline for each.
</P>
<UL>
<p class="quest">
	(a) a new (not yet delivered) ten person project, 
	where each component has a single primary engineer.
</P>
<p class="quest">
	(b) a three hundred person engineering department, 
	supporting dozens of projects on a large source-base for a 
	mature product that does weekly builds.  
	A particular component may or may not have a primary engineer, 
	but many people might have occasional need to change that component 
	(for bug fixes, or to add features for their own projects).
</P>
</UL>
<p class="quest">
The next three questions are general, and do not refer specifically to the above situations.
</P>
<UL>
<p class="quest">
	(c) discuss the respective advantages of blocking and warning when 
	someone attempts to check out a module that someone else is already 
	working on.
</P> <p class="quest">
	(d) why would a change control system need to know what version someone 
	started with when they attempt to check-in a change.
</P> <p class="quest">
	(e) suggest two different and reasonable ways of dealing with the 
	problem in part (d).
</P>
</UL>
</p><p class="ansr">
(a) ten person new project
</p>
<UL><p class="ansr">
	People can safely make all of their changes to the live sources,
	because nobody else should be making conflicting changes or be
	adversely affected by their work-in progress.
</p></UL>
<p class="ansr">
(b)300 person stable product
</p>
<UL><p class="ansr">
	In this situation there should be a master source tree, and only
	completely tested projects ready to integrate back should be 
	checked in to it.  Work in progress should be done in a local
	copy of that source tree, and the many changes made in that 
	working tree should be put back into the master tree as a single 
	huge transaction when the project is ready to integrate.
</p></UL>
<p class="ansr">
(c) block vs warn<br>
</p>
<UL><p class="ansr">
	Blocking a second person from checking out a source for change
	is an effective way to prevent conflicting check-ins ... but it
	precludes coordination as described below.  Warnings allow people
	to continue and manage the conflict in their own way ... but it
	leaves open the possibility of a failed put-back later.
</p></UL>
<p class="ansr">
(d) knowing starting version
</p>
<UL><p class="ansr">
	Knowing what version someone started with enables the change control
	mechanism to detect check-ins that may have been invalidated by 
	intervening changes made by other users between the time of check-out
	and check-in. 
</p><p class="ansr">
	It also enables the version control mechanism to figure out exactly
	what changes you made (by comparing it with your starting point).
</p></UL>
<p class="ansr">
(e) conflicting check-ins
</p>
<UL><p class="ansr">
	We could try to preempt the conflict, by noticing someone else was
	already working on the module and talking to them about how to 
	coordinate our changes.
</p><p class="ansr">
	Alternatively, the second person to put-back could re-check out the
	updated version and re-make their changes to the current version.
</p></UL>
