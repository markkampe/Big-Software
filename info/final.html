<h1> CS 181 Final Exam Overview</h1>
<h2> Instructor: Mark Kampe</h2>
</center>

<H2>Format</h2>
<P>
Closed book, 12 multi-part questions with relatively short (5-50 word) answers,
plus one extra-credit question.
<H2>Scope</h2>
<P>
Entirely drawn from the key learning objectives for the lectures
since the mid-term (Component/Class Design through Project scheduling
and task tracking).
<P>
<H2>Difficulty</h2>
<P>
<UL>
	<LI> 7 simple "do you remember" questions, whose individual
		parts are not much harder than quiz questions
		(although drawing on lecture and discussions as
		well as the reading).
	<LI> 4 moderate "can you describe/contrast/apply" questions,
		closely related to, and comparable in nature and 
		difficulty to in-class discussions.
	<LI> 1 moderate "consider this" questions, asking you to
		find an answer or appoach not specifically discussed 
		in class.
	<LI> 1 philosophical extra credit question, related to key
	 	concepts, but un-related to any reading or
		in-class discussion.
</UL>
<H2>Suggestions for study</h2>
<P>
Different study techniques are more effective for different people.
This is a general suggestion for review, that is meant only to guide
your own study efforts:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Start by reviewing the 
<A href=keys.html>key learning objectives</a>.
<LI>
If there is a concept, issue or technique that you don't 
think you could talk about for five minutes, go back and 
review the
<a Href=../slides/index.html>lecture notes</a>.  
<LI>
If anything in the lecture
notes (including the discussion points) is not completely obvious, 
go back and review the 
<A Href=../schedule.html>related reading</a>.
