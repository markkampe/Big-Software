All written work products for the projects in this course should
be maintained on GitHub.  <em>Git</em> seems to be the dominant
open source distributed version control system, and 
<A href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> offers free accounts
and a good set of tutorials.
<P>
There are a few steps you will have to follow, but they are not difficult:
<P>
<OL type=1>
   <LI>
	Each student will need to 
	<A Href="https://github.com/signup/free">Create a GitHub account</a>
	, which is free, fast and easy.
   </LI>
   <LI>
	Each student will need to 
	<A Href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">
	download, install, and configure</A>
	the Git software.
	If you get tired of entering your password, you can generate
	and up-load an
	<A Href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">
	ssh key</A> to GitHub.
   </LI>
   <LI>
	One member of each team will need to
	<A Href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo">create a repository</a>
	for each project.
   </LI>
   <LI>
	The simplest collaboration model is for the repository owner
	to add the other team members as
	<A Href="https://help.github.com/articles/how-do-i-add-a-collaborator">
	collaborators</A> in that repository.  Once this has been done, all
	of the team members will be able to directly push
	updates back to the project repository.<br>
	But, if you are feeling frisky a little later in the semester,
	and want to see learn how the <em>big kids</em> do it, you can try
	managing your project repo with
	<A Href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">
	forks and pull requests</A>.
   </LI>
</OL>
<P>
You will probably want to do some background reading on <em>git</em>.  
At the very least you should read:
<UL>
    <LI>
     <A Href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started"> 
	Pro Git chapters 1-1.3</a> ... Introduction to Git concepts
    </LI>
    <LI>
     <A Href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics"> 
	Pro Git chapters 2-2.3</a> ... Basic commands
    </LI>
</UL>
Before too long you will probably also want to read:
<UL>
    <LI>
	<A Href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things">
		Pro Git section 2.4</A> Discarding bad updates.</A>
    </LI>
    <LI>
	<A Href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes">
		Pro Git section 2.5</A> Working with remote servers 
		(<em>clone</em> and <em>push</em> operations).
    </LI>
    <LI>
	<A Href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging">
		Pro Git section 2.6</A> Creating and using <em>tags</em>.
    </LI>
</UL>
And you can use Git <em>in anger</em> you will need to understand branches:
<UL>
    <LI>
	<A Href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching">
		Pro Git Chapter 3</A> Branching.</A>
    </LI>
</UL>

<P>
To get you started, these are the commands you will use most often:
<UL>
    <LI>
	<strong>git clone https://github.com</strong>/<em>username</em>/<em>repository</em>.git <br>
	Create a local copy of the specified repository (owned by the specified user).<br>
	By default it will be created in the current working directory with the 
	same name it has on GitHub, but you can specify the name that the local
	directory should be given.
    </li>
    <LI>
	<strong>git status</strong><br>
	List all of the differences (both un-tracked, and uncommitted)
	between the current workspace and the
	committed state of the repository from which it came.
    </li>
    <LI>
	<strong>git add</strong> <em>file</em> ...<br>
	Note that the specified files have been created or changed, and should
	be included in the next commit.
    </li>
    <LI>
	<strong>git diff</strong> <em>file</em><br>
	Display a list of the differences between the specified file in the
	current workspace and the last committed version.
    </li>
    <LI>
	<strong>git rm</strong> <em>file</em> ...<br>
	Note that the specified files have are being deleted and should no longer
	be included in the repository.
    </li>
    <LI>
	<strong>git commit -m</strong> "<em>comments</em>" <em>file</em><br>
	Commit all of the staged changes, and associate the specified comment
	with this commit.<br>
	Note that this change has only been made to the local
	repository, and has not yet been pushed back to GitHub.
    </li>
    <LI>
	<strong>git log</strong> <em>file</em><br>
	Display the commit history for the specified file.
    </li>
    <LI>
	<strong>git tag -a</strong> <em>tagname</em> -m "<em>description</em>"<br>
	associate the specified <em>tagname</em> and <em>description</em>
	with the currently committed versions.
    </li>
    <LI>
	<strong>git pull</strong><br>
	Go back to the repository from which this local copy was cloned, 
	obtain all of the recent changes that have been made there, and
	merge those changes into the local copy.<br>
	If you want to get fancy (e.g. and review the changes before you
	try to merge them) you can do this in separate <strong>fetch</strong> 
	and <strong>merge</strong> operations.
    </li>
    <LI>
	<strong>git push origin master</strong><br>
	Take all of the changes that have been made in the local copy, and
	send them back to the master copy on GitHub.  Note that this operation
	will fail if there are changes on the master copy that have not yet
	been merged into the local copy (this is a safety feature).
    </li>
</UL>
