<H2>Format</h2>
<P>
Closed book, 10 multi-part questions with relatively short (5-50 word) answers,
plus one extra-credit question.
<H2>Scope</h2>
<P>
Entirely drawn from the key learning objectives for the first fifteen lectures
(introduction through design).<br>
Most (75%) of the questions focus primarily
on concepts and issues.  Less focus on techniques (which are covered in
the projects) and representations (which are pretty simple).
<P>
<H2>Difficulty</h2>
<P>
<UL>
	<LI> 3 simple "do you remember" questions, comparable in 
		nature and difficulty to quiz questions.
	<LI> 5 moderate "can you describe/contrast/apply" questions,
		comparable in nature and difficulty to in-class
		discussion questions.
	<LI> 2 moderate "consider this" questions, asking you to
		find answers not specifically discussed in class.
	<LI> 1 philosophical extra credit question, related to key
	 	concepts, but un-related to any reading or
		in-class discussion.
</UL>
<H2>Suggestions for study</h2>
<P>
Different study techniques are more effective for different people.
This is a general suggestion for review, that is meant only to guide
your own study efforts:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Start by reviewing the 
<A href=keys.html>key learning objectives</a>.
<LI>
If there is a concept, issue or technique that you don't 
think you could talk about for five minutes, go back and 
review the
<a Href=../slides/index.html>lecture notes</a>.  
<LI>
If anything in the lecture
notes (including the discussion points) is not completely obvious, 
go back and review the 
<A Href=../schedule.html>related reading</a>.
</UL>
