<P>
While a weight is shown for each project, there will not
be a "single grade" for each project.  
Each of the projects will involve a great many activities and
deliverables, each of which will be individually graded 
(and many of which will each be the subject of an entire lecture).
<P>
For each graded submission most of the grade will 
be a group-score (based on the overall quality of the submission).
A smaller portion of the grade will be personal, based on and
divided (more or less equally) between the
share and quality of each person's individual contributions
to the overall effort.
<P>
<H2>Rationale</h2>
<P>
I have two goals in grading:
<OL type=1>
	<LI> to assess your mastery of the material.
	<LI> to encourage you go get as much as possible out of this class.
</OL>
<P>
The greatest portion of the grade is evenly divided
between exams (your mastery of concepts) and projects (your
ability to apply skills and techniques).  On the projects,
I am weighting the overall result more than the individual
components because:
<OL type=a>
	<LI> in the real world you will be judged, not on
	     the basis of your individual efforts, but on
	     the overall quality of your results.
	<LI> teams are not merely a technique for allowing
	     individuals to do less work.  A well functioning
	     team can do work that none of the individuals
	     would have been able to do.
	<LI> work division and cooperation are skills
	     that are taught in this class.  I expect to
	     see the results of the applications of those skills.
</OL>
<P>
I am using 10% of the grade as a coercive tool, 
to encourage you to get the maximum benefit out
of the course:
<UL>
	<LI> Years of experience have consistently taught me that 
	     the greatest single predictor of how much a student
	     will get from a lecture is how well they understood
	     the material before the start of the lecture.
	    <P>
	     I have found (and student surveys regularly confirm)
	     that giving daily quizzes on the assigned reading gets
	     students to do the reading before the lecture, and 
	     greatly enhances learning.
	     <P>
	     I attempt to choose quiz questions, based on key concepts,
	     that should be trivial to answer based on a single reading.
	     Even though the questions are simple, you can earn double
	     credit for an answer that impresses me as particularly 
	     insightful.
	<LI> Non-trivial concepts cannot be usefully mastered merely
	     by reading about them.  Their implications and applications
	     must be explored.  In class discussions are the only place
	     where I have the opportunity to observe this process.
