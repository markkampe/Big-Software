Collaboration and Academic Honesty Policy
</center>
</h1>
<P>
Students are encouraged to get together in small groups to go over
material from the lectures and text, work problems from the text,
study for exams, and to discuss the general ideas and approaches to
material in the course.  You are also free to discuss (with anyone
in the class) the processes you are following in your projects.
</P>
<P>
Team members are expected to work together on projects, and it is
understood that most team submissions will include material created
and/or reviewed by all members of the team.
</P>
<P>
But, there are limitations on collaboration and research:
</P>
<UL>
   <LI>
	All quizzes and exams are individual and closed book.  
	You are not allowed to talk to other students about the
	answers or to use any reference materials during quizzes
	or exams.
   </li>
   <LI>
	Work you submit as your own must have been done by you.
	If you drew significant (e.g. more than one sentence)
 	inspiration from some outside source, cite that source and 
	identify what portion of it you used.
   </LI>
   <LI>
	You may not share your team work products (other than as required
	for presentations and reviews) with members of other teams.
   </LI>
</UL>
<p>Failure to abide by these rules is considered plagiarism, and will
result in severe penalties.  The first offense typically results in
failure in the course and referral to the appropriate college office
or committee.  See the Academic Honesty Policy in the Student Handbook
for further information.  Please do not put me, yourself, or anyone
else in this unpleasant situation.
