<h1> Software Engineering - Extra Credit</h1>
</center>

I have asked you, as teams, to do a post mortem review on each phase of
your project:
<OL type="a">
   <LI> to acquaint you with the process
   <LI> to try to get you into the habit of using each
	project as a learning opportunity.
   <LI> to help you learn the lessons that these experiences 
	have offerred you (none of which were unique to this
	course or these projects).
	
</OL>
This course has also been a learning project for me ... 
where I have tried out some new ideas and approaches.  
I would now like to ask you to do a post mortem review
on this offering of this course.
The potential value of this assignment is up to three points
on your final course grade:
<UL>
    <LI> as much as one point for review of the syllabus and assigned reading
    <LI> as much as one point for review of the lectures and in class activities
    <LI> as much as one point for review of the assigned projects
</UL>
<P>
I am not looking for, and will not award points for complements or complaints
about how much work the course is.  I am looking for:
<UL>
   <LI> descriptions of significant problems or short-fallings in this course
        (syllabus, reading, lectures, projects).</li>
   <LI> specfic, practical and actionable suggestions for how to address
        these problems or significantly improve the course.</li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
Awarded points will be proportional to the usefulness/actionability and
value of the suggestions.
</P>
These should be team submissions and are due at midnight on Sunday at the end of finals week.
