This is a concept-rich course and there is a great deal of reading,
averaging 45-50 pages per lecture.  A few days will be shorter
than this, and one of them is much longer.  Fortunately,
I think you will find that most of the material is simple enough to
be understood in a single reading.

The primary text for this course is Steve McConnell's 
<strong>Code Complete</strong> (second edition, ISBN-13: 978-0-7356-1967-8).
This is an excellent book, available in paperback, that you will 
probably keep for a very long time and replace when you 
eventually wear it out.

For more general Software Engineering topics, rather than force you
to buy an expensive Software Engineering text (half of which would be
unintersting), I have attempted to assemble a collection of
small, publically available articles on selected topics.  
URLs for all of these articles can be found on the
<A href="../schedule.html">reading and lecture schedule</A>.
