<title>Honor Code</title>

<p>
The Harvey Mudd Honor Code states that students are expected
to act as responsible individuals, to conduct themselves with
honesty and integrity both personally and academically and to
respect the rights of others.
The College considers these standards to be essential to its
academic mission and its community life.  
</p>
<p>
The following behaviors are inconsistent with the Honor Code:
<ul>
   <li>	<strong>Cheating</strong>:
   	using or attempting to use unauthorized assistance,
	material, or study aids in examinations or other academic work
	or preventing, or attempting to prevent another from using
	authorized assistance, material, or study aids.
	<p>
	Example: using a cheat sheet in a quiz or exam, using a cell
	phone or other technology to obtain or share information during
	an exam, altering a graded exam and resubmitting it for a better grade.
   	</p>
	<p>
	On projects, you are encouraged to review documentation, tutorials
	and tool-kits for the APIs and/or services you will be using.  But
	this does not extend to using reference/suggestion tools
	(e.g. <em>ChatGPT</em>) to produce designs or sample implementations.
	The purpose of these projects is to develop your ability to exploit
	new APIs and design new software.  If you ask someone else to design
	your software for you, you will not be learning the skills that will
	make you valuable.
	</p>
   </li>

   <li>	<strong>Plagiarism</strong>:
   	using the ideas, data, or language of another
	without specific or proper acknowledgment.
	<p>
	Example: copying
	another person's paper, article, or text from a website
	and submitting it for an assignment, quoting someone else's
	ideas without attribution, failing to use quotation marks where appropriate.
   </li>

   <li>	<strong>Fabrication</strong>:
   	submitting contrived or altered information
	in any academic exercise.
	<p>
	Example: making up data for an
	experiment, fudging data, citing nonexistent articles, contriving sources. 
	Multiple submissions: submitting, without prior permission,
	any work submitted to fulfill another academic requirement. 
   </li>

   <li>	<strong>Facilitating academic dishonesty</strong>:
   	knowingly helping or attempting
	to help another violate a provision of the Code.
	<p>
	Example: working together on a take-home exam. 
   </li>

   <li>	<strong>Unfair advantage</strong>:
   	attempting to gain unauthorized advantage
	over fellow students in an academic exercise.
	<p>
	Example: gaining or providing unauthorized access to examination
	materials, obstructing or interfering with another student's
	efforts in an academic exercise, lying about a need for an
	extension for an exam or paper, continuing to write even when
	time is up during an exam, destroying or keeping library materials
	for one's own use. 
   </li>
</ul>
